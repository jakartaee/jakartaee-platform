== Application Clients
:imagesdir: ../images

This chapter describes application clients
in the Jakarta™ Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE).

A full Jakarta EE product must support the
application client container as described in this chapter. A Jakarta EE
profile may or may not require support for the application client
container.

=== Overview

Application clients are first tier client
programs that execute in their own Java™ virtual machines. Application
clients follow the model for Java technology-based applications: they
are invoked at their _main_ method and run until the virtual machine is
terminated. However, like other Jakarta EE application components,
application clients depend on a container to provide system services.
The application client container may be very light-weight compared to
other Jakarta EE containers, providing only the security and deployment
services described below.

=== Security

The Jakarta EE authentication requirements for
application clients are the same as for other Jakarta EE components, and
the same authentication techniques may be used as for other Jakarta EE
application components.

No authentication is necessary when accessing
unprotected web resources. When accessing protected web resources, the
usual varieties of authentication may be used, namely HTTP Basic
authentication, SSL client authentication, or HTTP Login Form
authentication. Lazy authentication may be used.

Authentication is required when accessing
protected enterprise beans. The authentication mechanisms for enterprise
beans include those required in the Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification
for enterprise bean interoperability. Lazy authentication may be used.

An application client makes use of an
authentication service provided by the application client container for
authenticating its users. The container’s service may be integrated with
the native platform’s authentication system, so that a single signon
capability is employed. The container may authenticate the user when the
application is started, or it may use lazy authentication,
authenticating the user when a protected resource is accessed. This
specification does not describe the technique used to authenticate the
user, although a later version may do so.

If the container interacts with the user to
gather authentication data, the container must provide an appropriate
user interface. In addition, an application client may provide a class
that implements the _javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler_
interface and specify the class name in its deployment descriptor (see
<<a3399, Jakarta EE Application Client XML Schema>> for details). The Deployer may override the callback
handler specified by the application and use the container’s default
authentication user interface instead.

If a callback handler is configured by the
Deployer, the application client container must instantiate an object of
this class and use it for all authentication interactions with the user.
The application’s callback handler must fully support _Callback_ objects
specified in the _javax.security.auth.callback_ package.

Note that when HTTP Login Form authentication is
used, the authentication user interface provided by the server (in the
form of an HTML page delivered in response to an HTTP request) must be
displayed by the application client.

=== Transactions

Application clients are not required to have
direct access to the transaction facilities of the Jakarta EE platform. A
Jakarta EE product is not required to provide a Jakarta Transactions _UserTransaction_
object for use by application clients. Application clients can invoke
enterprise beans that start transactions, and they can use the
transaction facilities of the JDBC API. If a JDBC API transaction is
open when an application client invokes an enterprise bean, the
transaction context is not required to be propagated to the Jakarta Enterprise
Beans server.

=== Resources, Naming, and Injection

As with all Jakarta EE components, application
clients use JNDI to look up enterprise beans, get access to resource
managers, reference configurable parameters set at deployment time, and
so on. Application clients use the _java:_ JNDI namespace to access
these items (see <<a567, Resources, Naming, and Injection>> for details).

Injection is also supported for the
application client main class. Because the application client container
does not create instances of the application client main class, but
merely loads the class and invokes the static _main_ method, injection
into the application client class uses _static_ fields and methods,
unlike other Jakarta EE components. Injection occurs before the _main_
method is called.

=== Application Programming Interfaces

Application clients have all the facilities of
the Java™ Platform, Standard Edition (subject to security
restrictions), as well as various standard extensions, as described in
Chapter EE.6 “Application Programming Interface.” Each application
client executes in its own Java virtual machine. Application clients
start execution at the _main_ method of the class specified in the
_Main-Class_ attribute in the manifest file of the application client’s
JAR file (although note that application client container code will
typically execute before the application client itself, in order to
prepare the environment of the container, initialize the name service 
client library, and so on).

[[a3315]]
=== Packaging and Deployment

Application clients are packaged in JAR format
files with a _.jar_ extension and may include a deployment descriptor
similar to other Jakarta EE application components. The deployment
descriptor describes the enterprise beans, web services, and other types
of external resources referenced by the application. If the deployment
descriptor is not included, or is included but not marked
_metadata-complete_ , annotations on the main class of the application
client may also be used to describe the resources needed by the
application. As with other Jakarta EE application components, access to
resources must be configured at deployment time, names assigned for
enterprise beans and resources, and so on.

The following table describes the cases the
deployment tool must consider when deciding whether or not to process
annotations on the application client main class. Whether or not to
process annotations depends on the presence and version of the
deployment descriptor and the setting of the _metadata-complete_
attribute.

The _metadata-complete_ attribute defines
whether the application client deployment descriptor is complete, or
whether the class files available to the application client module
should be examined for annotations that specify deployment information.
Deployment information, in this sense, refers to any information that
could have been specified by the application client deployment
descriptor for the module.

If the value of the _metadata-complete_
attribute is specified as _“true”_ , the deployment tool must ignore any
annotations that specify such deployment information in the class files
packaged in the application client jar file. Such annotations must also
be ignored when processing the class files that are available to the
application client module for the deployment of this module according to
<<a3179, Deploying a Jakarta EE Application>>.

Note that a _"true"_ value for the
_metadata-complete_ attribute does _not_ preempt the processing of _all_
annotations, only those that specify deployment information.

The list of annotations to which the
_metadata-complete_ attribute applies currently includes the following:

*  _jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct_
*  _jakarta.annotation.PreDestroy_
*  _jakarta.annotation.Resource_
*  _jakarta.annotation.Resources_
*  _jakarta.annotation.sql.DataSourceDefinition_
*  _jakarta.annotation.sql.DataSourceDefinitions_

*  _jakarta.ejb.EJB_
*  _jakarta.ejb.EJBs_

*  _jakarta.jms.JMSConnectionFactoryDefinition_
*  _jakarta.jms.JMSConnectionFactoryDefinitions_
*  _jakarta.jms.JMSDestinationDefinition_
*  _jakarta.jms.JMSDestinationDefinitions_

*  _jakarta.mail.MailSessionDefinition_
*  _jakarta.mail.MailSessionDefinitions_

*  _jakarta.persistence.PersistenceUnit_
*  _jakarta.persistence.PersistenceUnits_

*  _jakarta.resource.AdministeredObjectDefinition_
*  _jakarta.resource.AdministeredObjectDefinitions_
*  _jakarta.resource.ConnectionFactoryDefinition_
*  _jakarta.resource.ConnectionFactoryDefinitions_


* All annotations in the following packages:
** _jakarta.jws_
** _jakarta.jws.soap_
** _jakarta.xml.ws_
** _jakarta.xml.ws.soap_
** _jakarta.xml.ws.spi_

If the _metadata-complete_ attribute is not
specified or its value is _"false"_ , the deployment tool must examine
the class files for all such annotations.

The tool used to deploy an application client
to the client machine, and the mechanism used to install the application
client, is not specified. Very sophisticated Jakarta EE products may allow
the application client to be deployed on a Jakarta EE server and
automatically made available to some set of (usually intranet) clients.
Other Jakarta EE products may require the Jakarta EE application bundle
containing the application client to be manually deployed and installed
on each client machine. And yet another approach would be for the
deployment tool on the Jakarta EE server to produce an installation package
that could be used by each client to install the application client.
There are many possibilities here and this specification doesn’t
prescribe any one. It only defines the package format for the
application client and the things that must be possible during the
deployment process.

How an application client is invoked by an end
user is unspecified. Typically a Jakarta EE Product Provider will provide
an application launcher that integrates with the application client
machine’s native operating system, but the level of such integration is
unspecified.

=== Jakarta EE Application Client XML Schema

The XML grammar for a Jakarta EE application client
deployment descriptor is defined by the Jakarta EE application-client
schema. The root element of the deployment descriptor for an application
client is _application-client_ . The content of the XML elements is in
general case sensitive. This means, for example, that
_<res-auth>Container</res-auth>_ must be used, rather than
_<res-auth>container</res-auth>_ .

All valid _application-client_ deployment
descriptors must conform to the XML Schema definition, or to a DTD or
schema definition from a previous version of this specification. (See
<<a3447, Previous Version Deployment Descriptors>>.) The deployment descriptor must be named
_META-INF/application-client.xml_ in the application client’s _.jar_
file. Note that this name is case-sensitive.

application-client XML Schema. The Jakarta EE application-client XML Schema
is located at
_https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/application-client_10.xsd_.
