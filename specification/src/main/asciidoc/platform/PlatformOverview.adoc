== Platform Overview

This chapter provides an overview of the
Jakarta™ EE Platform.

=== Architecture

The required relationships of architectural
elements of the Jakarta EE platform are shown in
<<a45, Jakarta EE Architecture Diagram>>.
Note that this figure shows the logical relationships of the
elements; it is not meant to imply a physical partitioning of the
elements into separate machines, processes, address spaces, or virtual
machines.

The Containers, denoted by the separate
rectangles, are Jakarta EE runtime environments that provide required
services to the application components represented in the upper half of
the rectangle. The services provided are denoted by the boxes in the
lower half of the rectangle. For example, the Application Client
Container provides Jakarta Messaging APIs to Application
Clients, as well as the other services represented. All these services
are explained below. See
<<a84, Jakarta EE Standard Services>>.

The arrows represent required access to other
parts of the Jakarta EE platform. The Application Client Container provides
Application Clients with direct access to the Jakarta EE required Database
through the Java API for connectivity with database systems, the JDBC™
API. Similar access to databases is provided to server pages, server faces
applications, and servlets by the Web Container, and to enterprise beans
by the Enterprise Beans Container.

As indicated, the APIs of the Java™
Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), are supported by Java SE runtime
environments for each type of application component.

The following sections describe the Jakarta EE
Platform requirements for each kind of Jakarta EE platform element.

=== Profiles

The Java EE 6 specification introduced the
notion of “profiles” (see
<<a3212, Profiles>>”).

A profile is a configuration of the Jakarta EE
platform targeted at a specific class of applications.

Profiles are not a new concept, nor are they
unique to the Jakarta EE platform. The Jakarta EE Specification process: “A
Specification that includes by reference a collection of Specifications and possibly additional requirements. APIs from the referenced Platform
Edition must be included according to the referencing rules set out in
that Platform Edition Specification. Other referenced specifications
must be referenced in their entirety.”

All Jakarta EE profiles share a set of common
features, such as naming and resource injection, packaging rules,
security requirements, etc. This guarantees a degree of uniformity
across all products and, indirectly, applications that fall under the
“Jakarta EE platform” umbrella. This also ensures that developers who are
familiar with a certain profile, or with the full platform, can move
easily to other profiles, avoiding excessive compartmentalization of
skills and experience.

Beyond the basic functionality outlined above,
profiles are free to include any set of technologies that are part of
the platform, provided that all rules in the present specification that
pertain to the included technologies—either alone or in combination with
others—are followed.

This last point is worth stressing. If profiles
only included pointwise technologies, they would be little more than
bundles of APIs with few or no tie-ins. Instead, the definition of
profiles adopted here guarantees that whenever this specification
defines requirements on combinations of technologies, these requirements
will be honored in all products based on Jakarta EE profiles.

As a concrete example, consider the use of
transactions in a servlet container. In isolation, neither the Jakarta Servlet
specification nor the Jakarta Transactions specification defines a
complete programming model for portable applications. This specification
fills that gap by introducing its own set of requirements that pertain
to the combination of servlets and Jakarta Transactions. These requirements must be
satisfied by any Jakarta EE profile-based product that includes those two
technologies, thus offering application developers a more complete
programming model shared across all relevant Jakarta EE profiles.

A separate specification, the Jakarta EE Web
Profile Specification, defines the Jakarta EE Web Profile, the first
profile of the Jakarta EE platform.

Additional profiles may be defined in
accordance with the rules of the Jakarta EE Specification Process and those
contained in the present specification. In particular, profiles are
initiated by submitting a Project Proposal to the Jakarta EE Specification Process and are released at
completion on their own schedule, independently of any concurrent
revision of the platform itself or of other profiles. This ensures
maximum flexibility in defining and releasing a new profile or an
updated version of an existing one.

In accordance with the definition of profiles
given above, a profile may end up being either a proper subset or a
proper superset of the platform, or it may overlap with it to a certain
extent. This flexibility guarantees that future profiles will be able to
cover uses well beyond those originally envisioned by the platform
specification.

As the previous paragraphs made clear, creating
a new profile is a significant undertaking. The decision to create a
profile should take into account its potential drawbacks, especially in
terms of fragmentation and developer confusion. In general, a profile
should be created only when there is a natural developer constituency
and a well-understood class of applications that can benefit from it. It
is also recommended that a profile cast a comprehensive net on its area
of interest, to minimize the occurrence of overlapping or competing
profiles. Jakarta EE platform features such as optional components and
extensibility can be used by profiles to achieve a better fit to their
intended target.

=== Application Components

The Jakarta EE runtime environment defines four
application component types that a Jakarta EE product must support:

* Application clients are Java programming
language programs that are typically GUI programs that execute on a
desktop computer. Application clients offer a user experience similar to
that of native applications and have access to all of the facilities of
the Jakarta EE middle tier.
* servlets, server pages, server faces applications,
filters, and web event listeners typically execute in a web container
and may respond to HTTP requests from web clients. Servlets, server pages,
server faces applications, and filters may be used to generate HTML pages that
are an application’s user interface. They may also be used to generate
XML or other format data that is consumed by other application
components. A special kind of servlet may provide support for web services
using the SOAP/HTTP protocol. Servlets, pages created with the
Jakarta Server Pages technology or Jakarta Server Faces technology, web
filters, and web event listeners are referred to collectively in this
specification as “web components.” Web applications are composed of web
components and other data such as HTML pages. Web components execute in
a web container. A web server includes a web container and other
protocol support, security support, and so on, as required by Jakarta EE
specifications.
* Jakarta Enterprise Beans components execute
in a managed environment that supports transactions. Enterprise beans
typically contain the business logic for a Jakarta EE application.
Enterprise beans may directly provide web services using the SOAP/HTTP
protocol.

==== Jakarta EE Server Support for Application Components

The Jakarta EE servers provide deployment,
management, and execution support for conforming application components.
Application components can be divided into three categories according to
their dependence on a Jakarta EE server:

* Components that are deployed, managed, and
executed on a Jakarta EE server. These components include web components
and Jakarta Enterprise Beans components. See the separate specifications for
these components.
* Components that are deployed and managed on a
Jakarta EE server, but are loaded and executed on a client machine.
These components include web resources such as HTML pages and applets
embedded in HTML pages.
* Components whose deployment and management is
not completely defined by this specification. Application Clients fall
into this category.

=== Containers

Containers provide the runtime support for Jakarta
EE application components. Containers provide a federated view of the
underlying Jakarta EE APIs to the application components. Jakarta EE
application components never interact directly with other Jakarta EE
application components. They use the protocols and methods of the
container for interacting with each other and with platform services.
Interposing a container between the application components and the Jakarta
EE services allows the container to transparently inject the services
required by the component, such as declarative transaction management,
security checks, resource pooling, and state management.

A typical Jakarta EE product will provide a
container for each application component type: application client
container, web component container, and enterprise
bean container.

==== Container Requirements

This specification requires that containers
support execution in a Java™ runtime environment, as defined by the Java
Platform, Standard Edition specification, v11 or later (Java SE 11 or later).

The container tools must understand the file
formats for the packaging of application components for deployment.

The containers are implemented by a Jakarta EE
Product Provider. See the description of the Product Provider role in
<<a162, Jakarta EE Product Provider>>.

This specification defines a set of standard
services that each Jakarta EE product must support. These standard services
are described below. The Jakarta EE containers provide the APIs that
application components use to access these services. This specification
also describes standard ways to extend Jakarta EE services with connectors
to other non-Jakarta EE application systems, such as mainframe systems and
ERP systems.

==== Jakarta EE Servers

Underlying a Jakarta EE container is the server of
which it is a part. A Jakarta EE Product Provider typically implements the
Jakarta EE server-side functionality using an existing transaction
processing infrastructure in combination with Java Platform, Standard
Edition (Java SE) technology. The Jakarta EE client functionality is
typically built on Java SE technology.

=== Resource Adapters

A resource adapter is a system-level software
component that typically implements network connectivity to an external
resource manager. A resource adapter can extend the functionality of the
Jakarta EE platform either by implementing one of the Java SE
service APIs (such as a JDBC™ driver), or by defining and implementing a
resource adapter for a connector to an external application system.
Resource adapters may also provide services that are entirely local,
perhaps interacting with native resources. Resource adapters interface
with the Jakarta EE platform through the Jakarta EE service provider
interfaces (Jakarta EE SPI). A resource adapter that uses the Jakarta EE SPIs
to attach to the Jakarta EE platform will be able to work with all Jakarta EE
products.

[[a82]]
=== Database

The Jakarta EE platform requires a database,
accessible through the JDBC API, for the storage of business data. The
database is accessible from web components, enterprise beans, and
application client components. The database need not be accessible from
applets. The Jakarta EE Product Provider must also provide a preconfigured,
default data source for use by the application in accessing this
database. See <<a2009, Default Data Source>>.

[[a84]]
=== Jakarta EE Standard Services

The Jakarta EE standard services include the
following (specified in more detail later in this document). Some of
these standard services are actually provided by Java SE.

==== HTTP

The HTTP client-side API is defined by the
_java.net_ package. The HTTP server-side API is defined by the Jakarta Servlet,
Jakarta Server Pages, and Jakarta Server Faces interfaces and by the web services support that is an optional part
of the Jakarta EE platform.

==== HTTPS

Use of the HTTP protocol over the SSL protocol
is supported by the same client and server APIs as HTTP.

==== Jakarta Transaction API (JTA)

The Jakarta Transactions consists of two parts:

* An application-level demarcation interface
that is used by the container and application components to demarcate
transaction boundaries.
* An interface between the transaction manager
and a resource manager used at the Jakarta EE SPI level.

[[a3538]]
==== RMI-IIOP (Optional)

Support for CORBA, including use of IIOP and
Java IDL, is Optional as of Jakarta EE 9. See
<<a2331, Optional Jakarta Technologies>>.

[[a3539]]
==== Java IDL (Optional)

Support for CORBA, including use of IIOP and
Java IDL, is Optional as of Jakarta EE 9. See
<<a2331, Optional Jakarta Technologies>>.

==== JDBC™ API

The JDBC API is the API for connectivity with
relational database systems. The JDBC API has two parts: an
application-level interface used by the application components to access
a database, and a service provider interface to attach a JDBC driver to
the Jakarta EE platform. Support for the service provider interface is not
required in Jakarta EE products. Instead, JDBC drivers should be packaged
as resource adapters that use the facilities of the Connector API to
interface with a Jakarta EE product. The JDBC API is included in Java SE,
but this specification includes additional requirements on JDBC device
drivers.

==== Jakarta Persistence API

Jakarta Persistence is the standard API
for the management of persistence and object/relational mapping. It
provides an object/relational mapping facility for application
developers using a Java domain model to manage a relational database.
Jakarta Persistence is required to be supported in Jakarta EE. It can
also be used in Java SE environments.

[[a104]]
==== Jakarta™ Messaging

Jakarta Messaging is a standard API for
messaging that supports reliable point-to-point messaging as well as the
publish-subscribe model. This specification requires a Jakarta Messaging provider that
implements both point-to-point messaging as well as publish-subscribe
messaging. The Jakarta EE Product Provider must also provide a
preconfigured, default Jakarta Messaging connection factory for use by the application
in accessing this JMS provider. See
<<a2025, Default Jakarta Messaging Connection Factory>>.

==== Java Naming and Directory Interface™ (JNDI)

The JNDI API is the standard API for naming and
directory access. The JNDI API has two parts: an application-level
interface used by the application components to access naming and
directory services and a service provider interface to attach a provider
of a naming and directory service. The JNDI API is included in Java SE,
but this specification defines additional requirements.

==== Jakarta™ Mail

Many Internet applications require the ability
to send email notifications, so the Jakarta EE platform includes the
Jakarta Mail API along with a Jakarta Mail service provider that allows an
application component to send Internet mail. The Jakarta Mail API has two
parts: an application-level interface used by the application components
to send mail, and a service provider interface used at the Jakarta EE SPI
level.

==== Jakarta Activation Framework (JAF)

The JAF API provides a framework for handling
data in different MIME types, originating in different formats and
locations. The Jakarta Mail API makes use of the JAF API. As of Jakarta EE 9, 
the Jakarta Activation Framework is now part of the Jakarta EE Platform.

==== XML Processing

The Java™ API for XML Processing (JAXP)
provides support for the industry standard SAX and DOM APIs for parsing
XML documents, as well as support for XSLT transform engines. The
Streaming API for XML (StAX) provides a pull-parsing API for XML. The
JAXP and StAX APIs are included in Java SE and so are available to Jakarta
EE applications.

==== Jakarta Connectors

Jakarta Connectors is a Jakarta EE SPI
that allows resource adapters that support access to Enterprise
Information Systems to be plugged in to any Jakarta EE product. The
Connector architecture defines a standard set of system-level contracts
between a Jakarta EE server and a resource adapter. The standard contracts
include:

* A connection management contract that lets a
Jakarta EE server pool connections to an underlying EIS, and lets
application components connect to an EIS. This leads to a scalable
application environment that can support a large number of clients
requiring access to EIS systems.
* A transaction management contract between the
transaction manager and an EIS that supports transactional access to EIS
resource managers. This contract lets a Jakarta EE server use a transaction
manager to manage transactions across multiple resource managers. This
contract also supports transactions that are managed internal to an EIS
resource manager without the necessity of involving an external
transaction manager.
* A security contract that enables secure
access to an EIS. This contract provides support for a secure
application environment, which reduces security threats to the EIS and
protects valuable information resources managed by the EIS.
* A thread management contract that allows a
resource adapter to delegate work to other threads and allows the
application server to manage a pool of threads. The resource adapter can
control the security context and transaction context used by the worker
thread.
* A contract that allows a resource adapter to
deliver messages to message driven beans independent of the specific
messaging style, messaging semantics, and messaging infrastructure used
to deliver messages. This contract also serves as the standard message
provider pluggability contract that allows a message provider to be
plugged into any Jakarta EE server via a resource adapter.
* A contract that allows a resource adapter to
propagate an imported transaction context to the Jakarta EE server such
that its interactions with the server and any application components are
part of the imported transaction. This contract preserves the ACID
(atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties of the
imported transaction.
* An optional contract providing a generic
command interface between an application program and a resource adapter.

==== Security Services

The Java™ Authentication and Authorization
Service (JAAS) enables services to authenticate and enforce access
controls upon users. It implements a Java technology version of the
standard Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) framework and supports
user-based authorization. Jakarta™ Authorization
defines a contract between a Jakarta EE
application server and an authorization service provider, allowing
custom authorization service providers to be plugged into any Jakarta EE
product. Jakarta™ Authentication
defines an SPI by which authentication providers
implementing message authentication mechanisms may be integrated in
client or server message processing containers or runtimes. Jakarta
Security leverages Jakarta Authentication, but provides an easier to use SPI for
authentication of users of web applications and defines identity store
APIs for authentication and authorization.

==== XML Web Services (Optional)

Jakarta EE optionally provides full support for both clients
of web services as well as web service endpoints. Several Jakarta
technologies work together to provide support for web services.
Jakarta XML Web Services
provides support for web service calls using the SOAP/HTTP
protocol. XML Web Services is the primary API for
web services and is a follow-on to Jakarta XML-based RPCfootnote:[Removed from Jakarta EE 9.]. 
Jakarta XML Web Services offers extensive web
services functionality, with support for multiple bindings/protocols.
Support for Jakarta XML-based RPC has been removed from the Platform as of Jakarta EE 9. See
<<a2333, Removed Jakarta Technologies>>.

Jakarta XML Web Services and Jakarta XML Binding
define the mapping between Java classes and XML as used
in SOAP calls, and provide support for 100% of XML Schema. 
The Jakarta SOAP with Attachments provides support for manipulating low
level SOAP messages. The Web Services for Jakarta EE specification fully
defines the deployment of web service clients and web service endpoints
in Jakarta EE, as well as the implementation of web service endpoints using
enterprise beans. The XML Web Services Metadata specification defines Java
language annotations that make it easier to develop web services. The
Jakarta XML Registries support has been removed from the Platform as of Jakarta EE
9. See <<a2333, Removed Jakarta Technologies>>.

==== Jakarta JSON Processing

Jakarta JSON Processing
provides a convenient way to process (parse, generate, transform, and
query) JSON text.

==== Jakarta JSON Binding

Jakarta JSON Binding provides a
convenient way to convert between JSON text and Java objects. 

==== Jakarta WebSocket

Jakarta WebSocket is a standard API for creating WebSocket
applications.

==== Jakarta RESTful Web Services

Jakarta RESTful Web Services
provides support for web services using the REST style. RESTful web
services better match the design style of the web and are often easier
to access using a wide variety of programming languages. Jakarta RESTful Web Services provides
a simple high-level API for writing such web services as well as a
low-level API that can be used to control the details of the web service
interaction.

==== Jakarta Concurrency

Jakarta Concurrency is a
standard API for providing asynchronous capabilities to Jakarta EE
application components through the following types of objects: managed
executor service, managed scheduled executor service, managed thread
factory, and context service.

==== Jakarta Batch

The Jakarta Batch
API provides a programming model for batch applications and a
runtime for scheduling and executing jobs.

==== Jakarta Enterprise Beans

For the Platform specification, the following two features are removed.

* Entity Beans, both Container and Bean Managed Persistence
* Embeddable EJB Container

=== Interoperability

Many of the APIs described above provide
interoperability with components that are not a part of the Jakarta EE
platform, such as external web or CORBA services.

<<a142, Jakarta EE Interoperability>> illustrates the interoperability facilities 
that may be available in the
Jakarta EE platform. (The directions of the arrows indicate the
client/server relationships of the components.)

[[a142]]
.Jakarta EE Interoperability
image::JakartaEEinteroperability.svg[]


=== Flexibility of Product Requirements

This specification doesn’t require that a Jakarta
EE product be implemented by a single program, a single server, or even
a single machine. In general, this specification doesn’t describe the
partitioning of services or functions between machines, servers, or
processes. As long as the requirements in this specification are met,
Jakarta EE Product Providers can partition the functionality however they
see fit. A Jakarta EE product must be able to deploy application components
that execute with the semantics described by this specification.

A typical low end Jakarta EE product will support
application clients each in their own Java virtual machine, and will
provide a single server that supports both web components and enterprise
beans. A high end Jakarta EE product might split the server components into
multiple servers, each of which can be distributed and load-balanced
across a collection of machines. While such machines might exist on-site
in an enterprise, they might also reside, for example, in a public
cloud. This specification does not prescribe or preclude any of these
configurations.

A wide variety of Jakarta EE product
configurations and implementations, all of which meet the requirements
of this specification, are possible. A portable Jakarta EE application will
function correctly when successfully deployed in any of these products.

[[a149]]
=== Jakarta EE Product Packaging

This specification doesn't include requirements
for the packaging of a Jakarta EE product. A Jakarta EE product might be
provided on distribution media, for download on the web, or as a service
available only on the web, for example. A Jakarta EE product must include
implementations of all the APIs required by this specification. These
implementations might depend on other software or services not included
in the Jakarta EE product. The customer may be required to combine or
configure the product with other software or services that are necessary
to meet the requirements of this specification. The documentation for
the Jakarta EE product must fully describe all the required software and
configuration.

For example, a Jakarta EE product might depend on
a database server, a naming service, a mail service, and/or a messaging
service. All configurations in which the product is defined to operate
must include all the software and services necessary to meet the
requirements of this specification.

Whether these services are available (running,
accessible on the network, properly configured, operating correctly,
etc.) may be controlled independently of the Jakarta EE product — they may
be unavailable when the Jakarta EE server is started, or they may fail
while the Jakarta EE server is running. This specification does not require
the Jakarta EE product to assure the availability of these services.
However, if such a service is needed to meet the requirements of this
specification, the Jakarta EE product must ensure that the service has been
configured for use and will be usable when it is available.

For example, this specification requires that
applications can use a database. If the Jakarta EE product requires a
database server to be separately installed, and requires the Jakarta EE
product to be configured to use that database, such configuration must
be done before applications are deployed. This ensures that the
operational environment of applications includes all the required
services.

=== Jakarta EE Product Extensions

This specification describes a minimum set of
facilities available to all Jakarta EE products. A Jakarta EE profile may
include some or all of these facilities, as described in
<<a3212, Profiles>>. Products
implementing the full Jakarta EE platform must provide all of them (see
<<a3252, Full Jakarta EE Product Requirements>>). 
Most Jakarta EE products will provide facilities beyond
the minimum required by this specification. This specification includes
only a few limits to the ability of a product to provide extensions. In
particular, it includes the same restrictions as Java SE on extensions
to Java APIs. A Jakarta EE product must not add classes to the Java
programming language packages included in this specification, and must
not add methods or otherwise alter the signatures of the specified
classes.

However, many other extensions are allowed. A
Jakarta EE product may provide additional Java APIs, either other Java
optional packages or other (appropriately named) packages. A Jakarta EE
product may include support for additional protocols or services not
specified here. A Jakarta EE product may support applications written in
other languages, or may support connectivity to other platforms or
applications.

Of course, portable applications will not make
use of any platform extensions. Applications that do make use of
facilities not required by this specification will be less portable.
Depending on the facility used, the loss of portability may be minor or
it may be significant.

We expect Jakarta EE products to vary widely and
compete vigorously on various aspects of quality of service. Products
will provide different levels of performance, scalability, robustness,
availability, and security. In some cases this specification requires
minimum levels of service. Future versions of this specification may
allow applications to describe their requirements in these areas.

=== Platform Roles

This section describes typical Jakarta Enterprise Edition roles.
In an actual instance, an organization may
divide role functionality differently to match that organization’s
application development and deployment workflow.

The roles are described in greater detail in
later sections of this specification.

[[a162]]
==== Jakarta EE Product Provider

A Jakarta EE Product Provider is the implementor
and supplier of a Jakarta EE product that includes the component
containers, Jakarta EE platform APIs, and other features defined in this
specification. A Jakarta EE Product Provider is typically an application
server vendor, a web server vendor, a database system vendor, or an
operating system vendor. A Jakarta EE Product Provider must make available
the Jakarta EE APIs to the application components through containers. A
Product Provider frequently bases their implementation on an existing
infrastructure.

A Jakarta EE Product Provider must provide the
mapping of the application components to the network protocols as
specified by this specification. A Jakarta EE product is free to implement
interfaces that are not specified by this specification in an
implementation-specific way.

A Jakarta EE Product Provider must provide
application deployment and management tools. Deployment tools enable a
Deployer (see <<a170, Deployer>>) to deploy application components on the Jakarta EE product.
Management tools allow a System Administrator (see
<<a178, System Administrator>>)
to manage the Jakarta EE product and the applications deployed on the Jakarta
EE product. The form of these tools is not prescribed by this
specification.

==== Application Component Provider

There are multiple roles for Application
Component Providers, including, for example, HTML document designers,
document programmers, and enterprise bean developers. These roles use
tools to produce Jakarta EE applications and components.

==== Application Assembler

The Application Assembler takes a set of
components developed by Application Component Providers and assembles
them into a complete Jakarta EE application delivered in the form of an
Enterprise Archive ( _.ear_ ) file. The Application Assembler will
generally use GUI tools provided by either a Platform Provider or Tool
Provider. The Application Assembler is responsible for providing
assembly instructions describing external dependencies of the
application that the Deployer must resolve in the deployment process.

[[a170]]
==== Deployer

The Deployer is responsible for deploying
application clients, web applications, and Enterprise Beans
components into a specific operational environment. The Deployer uses
tools supplied by the Jakarta EE Product Provider to carry out deployment
tasks. Deployment is typically a three-stage process:

. During Installation the Deployer moves
application media to the server, generates the additional
container-specific classes and interfaces that enable the container to
manage the application components at runtime, and installs application
components, and additional classes and interfaces, into the appropriate
Jakarta EE containers.
. During Configuration, external dependencies
declared by the Application Component Provider are resolved and
application assembly instructions defined by the Application Assembler
are followed. For example, the Deployer is responsible for mapping
security roles defined by the Application Assembler onto user groups and
accounts that exist in the target operational environment.
. Finally, the Deployer starts up Execution of
the newly installed and configured application.

In some cases, a specially qualified Deployer
may customize the business logic of the application’s components at
deployment time. For example, using tools provided with a Jakarta EE
product, the Deployer may provide simple application code that wraps an
enterprise bean’s business methods, or customizes the appearance of a
Jakarta Server Pages or Jakarta Server Faces page.

The Deployer’s output is web applications,
enterprise beans, applets, and application clients that have been
customized for the target operational environment and are deployed in a
specific Jakarta EE container.

For example, in the case of cloud deployments,
the Deployer would be responsible for configuring the application to run
in the cloud environment. The Deployer would install the application
into the cloud environment, configure its external dependencies, and
might handle aspects of provisioning its required resources.

[[a178]]
==== System Administrator

The System Administrator is responsible for the
configuration and administration of the enterprise’s computing and
networking infrastructure. The System Administrator is also responsible
for overseeing the runtime well-being of the deployed Jakarta EE
applications. The System Administrator typically uses runtime monitoring
and management tools provided by the Jakarta EE Product Provider to
accomplish these tasks.

For example, in a cloud scenario, the System
Administrator would be responsible for installing, configuring,
managing, and maintaining the cloud environment, including the resources
that are made available to applications running in the environment.

==== Tool Provider

A Tool Provider provides tools used for the
development and packaging of application components. A variety of tools
are anticipated, corresponding to the types of application components
supported by the Jakarta EE platform. Platform independent tools can be
used for all phases of development through the deployment of an
application and the management and monitoring of an application server.

==== System Component Provider

A variety of system level components may be
provided by System Component Providers. Jakarta Connectors
defines the primary APIs used to provide resource adapters of many
types. These resource adapters may connect to existing enterprise
information systems of many types, including databases and messaging
systems. Another type of system component is an authorization policy
provider as defined by the Jakarta Authorization specification.

=== Platform Contracts

This section describes the Jakarta EE contracts that must be fulfilled by a Jakarta EE Product
Provider implementing the full Jakarta EE platform. Jakarta EE profiles may
include some or all of these facilities, as described in
<<a3212, Profiles>>.

==== Jakarta EE APIs

The Jakarta EE APIs define the contract between the
Jakarta EE application components and the Jakarta EE platform. The contract
specifies both the runtime and deployment interfaces.

The Jakarta EE Product Provider must implement the
Jakarta EE APIs in a way that supports the semantics and policies described
in this specification. The Application Component Provider provides
components that conform to these APIs and policies.

==== Jakarta EE Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs)

The Jakarta EE Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs)
define the contract between the Jakarta EE platform and service providers
that may be plugged into a Jakarta EE product. The connector APIs define
service provider interfaces for integrating resource adapters with a
Jakarta EE application server. Resource adapter components implementing the
connector APIs are called Connectors. The Jakarta Authorization APIs
define service provider interfaces for integrating security
authorization mechanisms with a Jakarta EE application server.

The Jakarta EE Product Provider must implement the
Jakarta EE SPIs in a way that supports the semantics and policies described
in this specification. A provider of Service Provider components (for
example, a Connector Provider) should provide components that conform to
these SPIs and policies.

==== Network Protocols

This specification defines the mapping of
application components to industry-standard network protocols. The
mapping allows client access to the application components from systems
that have not installed Jakarta EE product technology. See
<<a2845, Interoperability>>, for
details on the network protocol support required for interoperability.

The Jakarta EE Product Provider is required to
publish the installed application components on the industry-standard
protocols. This specification defines the mapping of servlets and server
pages to the HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and the mapping of Jakarta Enterprise Beans components
to IIOP and SOAP protocols.

==== Deployment Descriptors and Annotations

Deployment descriptors and Java language
annotations are used to communicate the needs of application components
to the Deployer. The deployment descriptor and class file annotations
are a contract between the Application Component Provider or Assembler
and the Deployer. The Application Component Provider or Assembler is
required to specify the application component’s external resource
requirements, security requirements, environment parameters, and so
forth in the component’s deployment descriptor or through class file
annotations. The Jakarta EE Product Provider is required to provide a
deployment tool that interprets the Jakarta EE deployment descriptors and
class file annotations and allows the Deployer to map the application
component’s requirements to the capabilities of a specific Jakarta EE
product and environment.

=== Changes in J2EE 1.3

The J2EE 1.3 specification extends the J2EE
platform with additional enterprise integration facilities. The
Connector API supports integration with external enterprise information
systems. A JMS provider is now required. The JAXP API provides support
for processing XML documents. The JAAS API provides security support for
the Connector API. The EJB specification now requires support for
interoperability using the IIOP protocol.

Significant changes have been made to the EJB
specification. The EJB specification has a new container-managed
persistence model, support for message driven beans, and support for
local enterprise beans.

Other existing J2EE APIs have been updated as
well. See the individual API specifications for details. Finally, J2EE
1.3 requires support for J2SE 1.3.

=== Changes in J2EE 1.4

The primary focus of J2EE 1.4 is support for
web services. The JAX-RPC and SAAJ APIs provide the basic web services
interoperability support. The Web Services for J2EE specification
describes the packaging and deployment requirements for J2EE
applications that provide and use web services. The EJB specification
was also extended to support implementing web services using stateless
session beans. The JAXR API supports access to registries and
repositories.

Several other APIs have been added to J2EE 1.4.
The J2EE Management and J2EE Deployment APIs enable enhanced tool
support for J2EE products. The JMX API supports the J2EE Management API.
The J2EE Authorization Contract for Containers provides an SPI for
security providers.

Many of the existing J2EE APIs have been
enhanced in J2EE 1.4. J2EE 1.4 builds on J2SE 1.4. The JSP specification
has been enhanced to simplify the development of web applications. The
Connector API now supports integration with asynchronous messaging
systems, including the ability to plug in JMS providers.

Changes in this J2EE platform specification
include support for deploying class libraries independently of any
application and the conversion of deployment descriptor DTDs to XML
Schemas.

Other J2EE APIs have been enhanced as well. For
additional details, see each of the referenced specifications.

=== Changes in Java EE 5

With this release, the platform has a new name
– Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, or Java EE for short. This new name
gets rid of the confusing “2” while emphasizing even in the short name
that this is a Java platform. Previous versions are still referred to
using the old name “J2EE”.

The focus of Java EE 5 is ease of development.
To simplify the development process for programmers just starting with
Java EE, or developing small to medium applications, Java EE 5 makes
extensive use of Java language annotations, which were introduced by
J2SE 5.0. Annotations reduce or eliminate the need to deal with Java EE
deployment descriptors in many cases. Even large applications can
benefit from the simplifications provided by annotations.

One of the major uses of annotations is to
specify injection of resources and other dependencies into Java EE
components. Injection augments the existing JNDI lookup capability to
provide a new simplified model for applications to gain access to the
resources needed from the operational environment. Injection also works
with deployment descriptors to allow the deployer to customize or
override resource settings specified in the application’s source code.

The use of annotations is made even more
effective by providing better defaults. Better default behavior and
better default configuration allows most applications to get the
behavior they want most of the time, without the use of either
annotations or deployment descriptors in many cases. When the default is
not what the application wants, a simple annotation can be used to
specify the required behavior or configuration.

The combination of annotations and better
defaults has greatly simplified the development of applications using
Enterprise JavaBeans technology and applications defining or using web
services. Enterprise beans are now dramatically simpler to develop. Web
services are much easier to develop using the annotations defined by the
Web Services Metadata specification.

The area of web services continues to evolve at
a rapid pace. To provide the latest web services support, the JAX-RPC
technology has evolved into the JAX-WS technology, which makes heavy use
of the JAXB technology to bind Java objects to XML data. Both JAX-WS and
JAXB are new to this version of the platform.

Major additions to Java EE 5 include the JSTL
and JSF technologies that simplify development of web applications, and
the Java Persistence API developed by the EJB 3.0 expert group, which
greatly simplifies mapping Java objects to databases.

Minor additions include the StAX API for XML
parsing. Most APIs from previous versions have been updated with small
to medium improvements.

=== Changes in Java EE 6

Java EE 6 continues the “ease of development”
focus of Java EE 5.

One of the major improvements introduced in
Java EE 6 is the Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) technology,
which provides a uniform framework for the dependency injection and
lifecycle management of “managed beans”.

The Java EE 6 Managed Bean specification
defines the commonalities across the spectrum of Java EE managed
objects, extending from basic managed beans through EJB components.

The Bean Validation specification, introduced
in this release, provides a facility for validation of managed objects.
Bean Validation is integrated into the Java Persistence API, where it
provides an automated facility for the validation of JPA entities.

Java EE 6 adds the JAX-RS API as a required
technology of the Java EE Platform. JAX-RS is the API for the
development of Web services built according to the Representational
State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

Java EE 6 also introduces the Java EE Web
Profile, the first new profile of the Java EE Platform.

=== Changes in Java EE 7

Since its inception, the Java EE platform has
been targeted at offloading the developer from common infrastructure
tasks through its container-based model and abstraction of resource
access. In recent releases the platform has considerably simplified the
APIs for access to container services while broadening the range of the
services available. In this release we continue the direction of
improved simplification, while extending the range of the Java EE
platform to encompass emerging technologies in the web space.

The Java EE 7 platform adds first-class support
for recent developments in web standards, including Web Sockets and
JSON, which provide the underpinnings for HTML 5 support in Java EE.
Java EE 7 also adds a modern HTTP client API as defined by JAX-RS 2.0.

Also new in the Java EE 7 platform is the Batch
API, which provides a programming model for batch applications and a
runtime for scheduling and executing jobs, and the Concurrency Utilities
API, which provides asynchronous capabilities by means of managed
executor service, managed scheduled executor service, managed thread
factory, and context service.

The CDI dependency injection facility
introduced in Java EE 6 is enhanced as well as more broadly utilized by
the Java EE 7 platform technologies, and the managed bean model is
further aligned to remove inconsistencies among Java EE component
classes in aspects of CDI injection and interceptor support. The
declarative transaction functionality introduced by EJB is been made
available in a more general way through CDI interceptors, so that it may
be leveraged by other managed beans. The Bean Validation facility is
extended to the automatic validation of method invocations and likewise
made available via CDI interceptors.

Java EE 7 also continues the "ease of
development" focus of Java EE 5 and Java EE 6. Most notably, Java EE 7
includes a revised and greatly simplified JMS 2.0 API. Ease of
development encompasses ease of configuration as well. To that end, Java
EE 7 broadens the resource definition facilities introduced in Java EE 6
to encompass more of the standard platform resource types, and also
provides default database and JMS connection factory resources. It also
improves the configuration of application security, including new
descriptors for security permissions. Java EE 7 further simplifies the
platform by making optional the technologies that were identified as
candidates for pruning in Java EE 6, namely: EJB Entity Beans, JAX-RPC
1.1, JAXR 1.0, and JSR-88 1.2.

Finally, Java EE 7 lays groundwork for
enhancements to the platform for use in cloud environments in a future
release. Such features include resource definition metadata, improved
security configuration, and support for database schema generation via
the Java Persistence API.

=== Changes in Java EE 8

Java EE 8 continues the focus on modern web
applications of Java EE 7 and broadening the range of such applications.
Java EE 8 introduces the JSON Binding API (JSON-B) for mapping between
JSON text and Java objects, building on the JSON Processing API (JSON-P)
introduced in Java EE 7. The JSON Processing API itself is updated to
reflect additional JSON standards. Servlet undergoes major enhancement
with the addition of support for the new HTTP/2 protocol. JAX-RS adds
support for server-sent events and, building on concurrency facilities
added in Java SE 8, a reactive client API. The new Java EE Security API
provides enhanced support for authentication and authorization in web
modules, and also introduces APIs for access to identity stores. The
Bean Validation facility is updated to reflect enhancements made in Java
SE 8 and to extend the range of validated objects. While the focus of
CDI in this release is to extend its scope beyond Java EE with the
introduction of a bootstrapping API, CDI also includes enhancements for
event processing and alignment on Java SE 8 features.

=== Changes in Jakarta EE 8

Jakarta EE 8 is the migration of Java EE 8 from the JCP to the Eclipse Foundation.
Reference the <<specificationComparison, "Specification Comparison">> and <<revisionHistory, “Revision History">> appendices for more information.

=== Changes in Jakarta EE 9

The goal of the Jakarta EE 9 release is to deliver a set of specifications functionally similar to Jakarta EE 8 but in the new Jakarta EE 9 namespace `jakarta.*`.

In addition, the Jakarta EE 9 release removes a small set of specifications from Jakarta EE 8 that were old, optional, or deprecated in order to reduce the surface area of the APIs to ensure that it is easier for new vendors to enter the ecosystem – as well as reduce the burden on implementation, migration, and maintenance of these old APIs.

Predominantly, Jakarta EE 9 is a tooling release:

- A platform from which tooling vendors can create and update their tools to support the new `jakarta.*` namespace.
- A platform that development teams can use as a stable target for testing migration of their applications to the new namespace.
- A platform that runtime vendors can use to test and deliver options and capabilities that support migration and backwards compatibility with Jakarta EE 8.
- A foundation for innovation that Jakarta EE specification projects can use to drive new features for release in Jakarta EE 10 and beyond.

=== Changes in Jakarta EE 9.1

The goal of the Jakarta EE 9.1 release is to deliver a set of specifications functionally equivalent to Jakarta EE 9 and adding the support for the Java SE 11 runtime.

Jakarta EE 9.1 is an extension to the foundational Jakarta EE 9 release.
No API updates are expected in Jakarta EE 9.1.
Only the Platform and Web Profile Specifications along with the TCKs and Compatible Implementations should be affected by Jakarta EE 9.1.

=== Changes in Jakarta EE 10
The goal of the Jakarta EE 10 release is to deliver a set of specifications that  and adding the support for the Java SE 11 and newer runtimes. The TCKs require support for both Java SE 11 and Java SE 17.

Jakarta EE 10 is the first release in the Jakarta EE series to include major and minor component specification updates not limited to the javax to jakarta package namespace change.

Jakarta EE 10 also introduced a new Core Profile to support smaller runtime footprints as often used with microservices.
