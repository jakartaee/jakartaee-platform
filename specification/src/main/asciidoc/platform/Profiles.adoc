== Profiles

This chapter describes the requirements
common to all Jakarta(TM) EE profiles. It does not define any concrete
profiles, delegating this task to separate specifications.

The Jakarta EE Web Profile Specification,
published in conjunction with the present specification, defines the
first Jakarta EE profile, the Web Profile.

The Jakarta EE Core Profile Specification is a minimal profile that is published separately from the Web Profile and this Platform specification.

The definition of other profiles is left to
future specifications.

=== Introduction

A Jakarta EE profile (from now on, simply “a
profile”) represents a configuration of the platform suited to a
particular class of applications.

A profile may contain a proper subset of the
technologies contained in the platform. By doing so, a profile can
effectively drop technologies which the platform supports but which are
not generally useful in a particular domain.

A profile may also add one or more
technologies which are not present in the platform itself. For example,
a hypothetical Jakarta EE Portal Profile would likely include the Portlet
API (JSR-362).

Additionally, a profile may tag certain
technologies as optional. In this case, products implementing the
profile may or may not include the technology in question. Naturally, if
they do, they need to obey all the relevant requirements mandated by the
profile specification.

A product may implement two or more Jakarta EE
profiles, or the full platform and one or more Jakarta EE profiles, as long
as their combined requirements do not give rise to conflicts.

=== Profile Definition

A profile is defined in accordance with the
rules of the Jakarta EE Specification Process. Typically, a proposal to create a
new profile, or to revise an existing one, will be submitted as a Jakarta Specification
Project. Once the Project is approved, a group of interested parties
will be formed and conduct work as dictated by the process. The Project proposal for
a profile must mention the version of the Jakarta EE Platform that it
builds on. Additionally, if it builds on an existing profile, it must
mention this fact as well.

Although profiles can be created and evolved
independently of the Jakarta EE platform, modulo the rules contained in
this specification, it is envisioned that profiles will maintain a
reasonable level of alignment with the platform itself, in order to
avoid fragmenting the development space into progressively incompatible
islands. To this end, a profile must build on the most recent version of
the Jakarta EE platform available at the time the Project for the profile is
approved. It is also recommended that profile community groups go beyond
this requirement and, as much as it is practical, ensure that their
profile builds on the most recent version of the Jakarta EE platform at the
time the profile is finalized.

=== General Rules for Profiles

A profile must include all technologies that
are required components of the Jakarta EE platform or of any profiles on
which it builds. These technologies will be listed as required in the
profile.

A profile may promote to required status any
technologies that are optional components of the Jakarta EE platform or of
any profile on which it builds.

Unless otherwise mandated by a profile, any
technologies that are optional components of the Jakarta EE platform, or of
any profile on which the profile in question builds, must be optional
components of the profile itself.

A profile may include as a required or as an
optional component any technology outside of those included in the Jakarta
EE platform or any profile on which it builds, as long as the
corresponding compatibility requirements are satisfied.

A profile must preserve any requirements
defined in the Jakarta EE platform specification, or in the specification
of any profile on which it builds, as long as the preconditions for
those requirements are satisfied. Typically, the preconditions will
involve the presence of one or more technologies among those included in
the profile. Unconditional requirements must be obeyed unconditionally.

A profile may add any requirements that
pertain to one or more technologies whose inclusion it allows or
requires. Such requirements must not conflict with those set by the Jakarta
EE platform or by any profile on which the present one builds.

The specification for individual technologies
may allow for certain features of the technology in question to be
optional. In this case, a profile may promote one or more of these
features to required status, assuming the Jakarta EE platform or any
profile on which it builds hasn’t done so already.

A profile must not conflict with the
specifications for any technologies it includes either as required or
optional components. Therefore, unless the specification for an
individual technology explicitly allows for certain features or sets of
requirements to be optionally implementable, a profile must not itself
attempt to redefine any such features or requirements. For example, a
profile may not allow omitting a package or type or method from an API
specified elsewhere, unless the specification for that API explicitly
allows for this to happen.

Although the Platform specification does not define
any APIs, a profile may do so. Since such an API would be available only
in profiles that build on the one that defines it, this approach limits
the reusability of the API and thus is discouraged.

=== Expression of Requirements

The present specification uses the following
conventions when expressing requirements that pertain to one or more
technologies included in the platform:

* Chapters or sections which are conditional
on the presence of a specific technology are marked as such at the very
beginning. The condition is then intended to stay in force until the
next textual unit at the same logical level (e.g. the following chapter,
or section, etc.).
* Individual paragraphs and sentences are
deemed to be conditional on any technologies they mention, unless
otherwise indicated.
* Section or paragraphs which discuss
examples, or are otherwise non-normative, do not contain any
requirements.

=== Requirements for All Jakarta EE Profiles

The Java Platform, Standard Edition 11 is the
required API compilation level for any Jakarta EE profile.

The following technologies are required to be
present in all Jakarta EE profiles:

* Component lifecycle annotations defined by the Jakarta Annotations specification ( _PostConstruct_, _PreDestroy_ )

=== Optional Features for Jakarta EE Profiles

All the technologies listed in
<<a2136, Required APIs>>, and
not designated as required in
<<a3240, Requirements for All Jakarta EE Profiles>>, are designated as optional for use in Jakarta EE
profiles.

The following functionality is designated as
optional for use in Jakarta EE profiles:

* CORBA requirements (see
<<a2875, OMG Protocols>>)
* Support for _java:comp/ORB_ (see
<<a1385, ORB References>>)

=== Full Jakarta™ EE Product Requirements

This section defines the requirements for
full Jakarta EE platform products. These requirements correspond to the
full set of requirements in previous versions of the Jakarta EE platform
specification and update those requirements for this new version of the
platform.

Please note that, due to the effects of the
feature lifecycle process, future versions of the Jakarta EE specification will
likely relax the requirements given here, specifically by marking as
optional technologies that are
required by the present specification. The set of technologies that have
been made optional and/or identified as proposed optional is given
in <<a2331, Optional Java Technologies>>.

The following technologies are required:

* Jakarta Activation 2.1
* Jakarta Annotations 3.0*
* Jakarta Authentication 3.1*
* Jakarta Authorization 3.0*
* Jakarta Batch 2.1
* Jakarta Concurrency 3.1*
* Jakarta Connectors 2.1
* Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 4.1*
* Jakarta Data 1.0*
* Jakarta Debugging Support for Other Languages 2.0
* Jakarta Dependency Injection 2.0
* Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 (except for Jakarta Enterprise Beans entity beans and associated Jakarta Enterprise Beans QL, and embedded container, which have been made removed)
* Jakarta Expression Language 6.0*
* Jakarta Interceptors 2.2*
* Jakarta JSON Processing 2.1
* Jakarta JSON Binding 3.0
* Jakarta Mail 2.1
* Jakarta Messaging 3.1
* Jakarta Persistence 3.2*
* Jakarta RESTful Web Services 4.0*

* Jakarta Server Faces 4.1*
* Jakarta Server Pages 4.0*
* Jakarta Standard Tag Library 3.0
* Jakarta Transactions 2.0
* Jakarta Validation 3.1*
* Jakarta WebSocket 2.2*

*Note:* technologies with an asterisk after them represent updated versions.

The following technologies are deprecated:
* NONE

The following technologies are removed:

* Jakarta Enterprise Beans 3.2 and earlier entity beans and associated Jakarta Enterprise Beans QL
* Jakarta Enterprise Beans 2.x API group
* Jakarta Managed Beans
* Jakarta SOAP with Attachments
* Jakarta XML Binding
* Jakarta XML Web Services

Besides the Jakarta Managed Beans specification, Jakarta EE platform products can continue to support the removed specifications
just like any other standalone specification that is not part of the platform.
