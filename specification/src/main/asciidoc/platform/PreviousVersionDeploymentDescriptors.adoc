== Previous Version Deployment Descriptors

This appendix describes Document Type
Definitions (DTDs) and XML schemas for Deployment Descriptors from previous
versions of the Java(TM) EE and Jakarta(TM) EE specifications.
All Jakarta EE 9 products are required
to support the DTDs and schemas specified by Jakarta EE 8,
as well as the schemas specified in this version of the specification. 
This ensures that applications
written to the previous version of the Jakarta EE specification can be deployed on
products supporting the current version of this specification. 
Support for versions of DTDs and schemas prior to Jakarta EE 8 is optional.
In addition, there are no restrictions on mixing versions of supported deployment
descriptors in a single application; any combination of valid deployment
descriptor versions must be supported.

=== Jakarta EE 11 shcemas

Reference this page, https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/#11, for the schema definitions defined for Jakarta EE 11.

=== Jakarta EE 10 schemas

Reference this page, https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/#10, for the schema definitions defined for Jakarta EE 10.

=== Jakarta EE 9 schemas

A new namespace has been specified for Jakarta EE 9, https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/.
Reference this page, https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/#9, for the schema definitions defined for Jakarta EE 9.

=== Java EE 8 / Jakarta EE 8 Schemas

No updates to the schemas defined in previous releases of Java EE were required for Java EE 8 or Jakarta EE 8.
Reference this page, https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/#8, for the schema definitions defined for Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 8.

=== Java EE 7 Schemas

==== Java EE 7 Application XML Schema

The XML grammar for a Java EE 7 application
deployment descriptor is defined by the Java EE 7 application schema. The
root element of the deployment descriptor for a Java EE application is
_application_ . The granularity of composition for Java EE application
assembly is the Java EE module. A Java EE application deployment
descriptor contains a name and description for the application and the
URI of a UI icon for the application, as well a list of the Java EE
modules that comprise the application. The content of the XML elements
is in general case sensitive. This means, for example, that
_<role-name>Manager</role-name>_ is a different role than
_<role-name>manager</role-name>_ .

All valid Java EE 7 application deployment
descriptors must conform to the XML Schema definition, or the DTD or
schema definition from a previous version of this specification. The
deployment descriptor must be named _META-INF/application.xml_ in the
_.ear_ file. Note that this name is case-sensitive.

specification and in other specifications.

==== Java EE 7 Application Client XML Schema

The XML grammar for a Java EE 7 application
client deployment descriptor is defined by the Java EE 7
application-client schema. The root element of the deployment descriptor
for an application client is _application-client_ . The content of the
XML elements is in general case sensitive. This means, for example, that
_<res-auth>Container</res-auth>_ must be used, rather than
_<res-auth>container</res-auth>_ .

All valid _application-client_ deployment
descriptors must conform to the XML Schema definition, or to a DTD or
schema definition from a previous version of this specification. The
deployment descriptor must be named _META-INF/application-client.xml_ in
the application client’s _.jar_ file. Note that this name is
case-sensitive.
