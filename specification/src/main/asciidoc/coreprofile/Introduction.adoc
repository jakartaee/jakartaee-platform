== Introduction

This specification defines the Jakarta(TM) EE Core Profile (“Core Profile”), a profile of the Jakarta™ Platform, Enterprise
Edition specifically targeted at smaller applications built around microservices.

=== Target and Rationale for the Core Profile

The Core Profile is targeted at developers of
modern cloud applications with focus on a minimal set of APIs
that support microservices with a focus on enabling implementations
that make use of ahead of time compilation build to minimize startup
time and memory footprint.

It is worth noting that Core Profile products are allowed to ship with more technologies than the
required ones. It is conceivable that products will offer a choice at
installation time/or build time between different configurations, some richer in
extensions, or even allow for complete customization beyond the required
core (“à la carte” installation).

=== Determining Applicable Requirements

NOTE: Profile definitions can be quite terse, amounting to little more than a list of required technologies and a
(possibly empty) set of additional requirements, beyond those entailed by all the referenced specifications.

As dictated by the general rules for Jakarta EE profiles in the Platform specification, products that implement the Core
Profile must honor:

. all requirements of the common requirements section that applies to all profiles;
. all requirements of this specification;
. all requirements of the individual component specifications;
. all requirements in the Jakarta EE Platform specification that are conditional on the presence of a specific
technology or combinations of technologies.

Let’s look at some examples of requirements from each grouping.

For the first one, the Jakarta EE Platform
specification mandates support for Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition 17 API.  Because of this, all Core Profile 11.0 APIs must support the Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition 17 API.

In the second category one can point out the
that Jakarta XML Binding support is not required for Jakarta RESTful Web Services in the Core Profile.
(<<additional_requirements, see Additional Requirements>>).

The third category is hopefully
self-explanatory. For example, Core Profile products must implement the Jakarta RESTful Web Services API, which in turn means they need to satisfy all the requirements listed in the Jakarta RESTful Web Services specification.

The fourth category is the most complex. The Jakarta Core Profile TCK attempts to validate the ability to combine the individual component specifications into composite test applications.
