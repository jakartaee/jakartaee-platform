## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)
* Slow going on the component specs:

* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTUpfdLZZrk2_UGwoX2w0seOCueRO3sQJIjWxpDAa7g/edit?pli=1#gid=35969432](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTUpfdLZZrk2_UGwoX2w0seOCueRO3sQJIjWxpDAa7g/edit?pli=1#gid=35969432)

* 5 specs still have no status regarding a release; messaging 3.1, concurrency 3.0 (Nathan Rauh to provide?), authentication 3.0 (status on mailing list), authorization 2.1 (status on mailing list), connectors 2.1
    * Estimate for when release can be done
    * Is February 28 achievable? Otherwise the previous version of the spec will be used
    * Everything doesn’t need to be done by Feb 28, but a commitment for being able to deliver in Q1. A PR for the final release review must be created by then:
        * API jars
        * Draft spec documents

* Someone from the specification committee needs to start a plan review for interceptors 2.1. PR is here: [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/447](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/447)
    * **ACTION:** Emily will review the PR and start the ballot

* Scott is waiting for committer permission issues to be resolved to create the 2.1.0-RC2 interceptors release. Changes are in the main branch.
    * **ACTION:** Emily will start the job to release 

### Release Mx/RCx artifacts to Maven Central discussion

* Specs with dependencies on other specs must ensure that RCs of the dependencies are available on Central before releasing RCs

* **Conclusion:** Publishing RCs are ok, and should be done. Care must be taken that dependencies are also in Central. Pay attention to the order of releasing from staging.

* **ACTION:** Scott Stark will write up the process and put it on the [wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/wiki/Milestones-and-Release-Candidates)

### TCK package uses for EE10 seems unclear. Are there TCK releasing for EE10 with jakarta package namespace artifacts?
* Concern about future TCK challenges due to use of `jakarta` in test packages.

* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonp](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonp)
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonp/pull/351](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonp/pull/351) ???

* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonb-api

* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/pull/1082](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/pull/1082) ???

* General agreement that ‘jakarta’ namespace (starting with ‘jakarta’) must be avoided in EE10 TCKs
    * Any non-’jakarta’ namespace is ok for EE10
    * Consistency can be fixed later if desired
    * Bring up to the spec committee that the usage statement for the jakarta namespace must be worded less ambiguous 
    * Continue discussion on mailing list
    * Issue in the platform project: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/457

_The following topic was not covered in this call:_

### Deprecate permissions.xml?

* Deprecate in EE 10, prune in EE 11?

* Continue discussion on [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03175.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03175.html)
