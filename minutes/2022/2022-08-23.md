## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* Core profile ballot complete
* Web profile and Full platform waiting on steps outlined by Ed
    * [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03663.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03663.html) 
    * Final concurrency TCK
        * Is this the latest? [https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/cu/jakartaee10/staged/eftl/concurrency-tck-3.0.2.zip](https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/cu/jakartaee10/staged/eftl/concurrency-tck-3.0.2.zip) 
    * CCRs for Web Profile and Full Platform
        * TCKs currently running against GlassFish 7.0.0-nightly
            * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-results](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-results) 
        * GlassFish 7.0.0.M7 pass everything except Concurrency.
        * Running M7 against [Concurrency TCK 3.0.2](https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/cu/jakartaee10/staged/eftl/concurrency-tck-3.0.2.zip) enough?
        * GlassFish 7.0.0.M7 must be verified against the staged Platform- and Web Profile TCK and CCR updated with the corresponding SHA256 since it has evolved since the original run
        * **GlassFish 7.0.0.M8 will be released and used in the complete test runs**
        * The Concurrency TCK 3.0.2 must be promoted by the spec committee. Will be done as soon as the Concurrency project has created a PR with the new link to update the [spec page](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency/3.0/).
            * Arjan will create a PR
                * Include link to 3.0.2
                * Update CCR/Test results for GlassFish (verify those for TCKs that are changed)
                    * Concurrency + Platform 

### Handling of Platform CCRs

* Do we really need one CCR per Java version?
* CCRs are approved by lazy consensus after 14 days
* If a faster resolution is required (e.g. due to product announcements), ping a committer to take a look at it
* Suggestion to make this a standing item on the agenda of this call
