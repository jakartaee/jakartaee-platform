## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)
* Improvements on status of projects in tracking spreadsheet.
    * Annotation is (almost) ready for ballot
* Need RC releases of API artifacts:
    * Messaging, one outstanding PR for module-info
    * Concurrency
        * Opted to not do a RC
        * A proposed final is available on staging
    * Transactions - one outstanding PR for module-info
    * Connectors
* Projects needing help should create issues and ask the platform group. Projects are doing this.
* Discussion around RCs
    * Signature tests must pass
    * Does not need to be a final version of the API artifact
    * **The TCK must be a released version, and associated sha-256 must be correct**
    * ACTION: Ask the Spec Committee to clarify (Scott)

### Split-out TCKs

* May be two versions of TCKs, one in the platform TCK and one split out* If platform spec requirements are met by the new, split-out, TCK then this is sufficient

* TCK User Guides must specify what is needed for the platform 
* An issue should be created for each spec that have split out their TCK, so the platform team can decide how to address it:
    * Jakarta JSON-B
    * Jakarta JSON-P
    * Jakarta RESTful Web Services
    * Jakarta Faces
    * Jakarta Batch
* Scott Marlow will schedule a call with the TCK team and Jakarta JSON-B this week
    * Identify the platform requirements for which containers need to be tested with each SPEC API (JSON-P + JSON-B specifically).
        * Goal is to avoid duplication of test sources for each SPEC API TCK + Platform
        * Post minutes from call
        * Invite list (add name here)
            * Scott Marlow
            * Scott Stark
            * Dmitry Kornilov

### Deprecate permissions.xml? (carryover from last call)

* Deprecate in EE 10, prune in EE 11?
* Continue discussion on [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03175.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03175.html)
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/460](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/460) 

### Jakarta EE dependency graph generated with jQAssistant [Dirk, Gerd, Jan]

* Current state and features
* Jakarta EE 9.1 findings
* [https://github.com/jqassistant-demo/jakarta-ee-dependencies](https://github.com/jqassistant-demo/jakarta-ee-dependencies) 
* [https://jqassistant.org/](https://jqassistant.org/)
* Current results attached here: [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03207.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03207.html) 
* Based on their experience with Neo4J, maybe some of the jQAssistant contributors might also like to have a look at [Jakarta NoSQL](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/nosql/).Either to get involved or use it in a future version of the tool, especially to be independent of a particular system like Neo4J ;-)
