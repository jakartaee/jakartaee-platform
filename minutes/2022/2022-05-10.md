## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* All component specs in ballot. Will be done by 
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/pull/966](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/pull/966) Core Profile TCK
    * WildFly passes
    * Pull Request created

* Should be able to have Core Profile ready for ballot next week

* Full Platform TCK has 922 failures under Java SE 11
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-results](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-results)
    * Still have issues with Java SE 17 runs
        * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/23915#issuecomment-1118223770](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/23915#issuecomment-1118223770)
        * Does GlassFish need to pass full TCK on SE 17?
            * At least one implementation will need to pass with optional features on SE 17 as well as SE 11
        * Other vendors will pass without optional features

* Arjan reported no SE 17 related failures in the GlassFish tests (not TCK)
    * Suspected TCK setup issue? Related to “add-opens”?
    * Adding add-opens brought the failures down from around 5200 to 2200 failures
    * Removal of JSP support in Faces caused a lot of tests being updated last minute in the Faces TCK
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-result](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-result)  

* An option to exclude failing tests (EJB Lite related)?
    * Tests using removed technologies (not depended on SE version)	 

* Discussed, and agreed to adjust the schedule:
    * Proposal: Start ballot on June 9, Release date: June 23 
    * Schedule TCK calls weekly to get deeply into technical issues. First will be

        * Join Zoom Meeting [https://eclipse.zoom.us/j/96059419718](https://eclipse.zoom.us/j/96059419718)
        * Meeting ID: 960 5941 9718
    * Keep the Platform TCK Wiki for results. No need for a platform wiki for this

* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/issues/963](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/issues/963)  

### Service releases for TCK updates can be done at any time

* We need a TCK wiki page that lists where GlassFish is running each new TCK
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/New-EE-10-Standalone-TCKs-and-CI-used-to-test-each-with-GlassFish](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/New-EE-10-Standalone-TCKs-and-CI-used-to-test-each-with-GlassFish) is blank currently 

### Consistency for the standalone TCKs is something we need to look at for future releases

* Packaging
* User Guide
* Installation
* Distribution
* Use Core Profile TCK as an example (starting point)

### Initial TCK doc update 

* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/pull/958](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/pull/958)
