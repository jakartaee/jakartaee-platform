## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* Missing concurrency schema updates?
    * https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-schemas/issues/38
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-schemas/issues/28](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-schemas/issues/28) - added `&lt;context-service>`, `&lt;managed-executor>`, `&lt;managed-scheduled-executor>`, `&lt;managed-thread-factory>` types to the jakartaee_10.xsd **<code>jndiEnvironmentRefsGroup</code></strong> (now poorly named) element. These have not been updated in the published schemas.
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/pull/1472](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/pull/1472) - existing PR has been updated

* Need release of common annotations for ManagedBean deprecation
    * Need signature tests updated
        * In staging
    * Need jakartaee-api updated
        * PR created
    * GlassFish will need to pick up these changes
        * Create PR to GF

* Different approach to ratifying platform/profile specs?
    * Composite CCRs
    * De facto RI - current approach
    * Current Process: [https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/?version=1.2](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/?version=1.2)  \
“...<em>A Specification Version must identify at least one Compatible Implementation under an Open Source License that implements all optional elements of the Specification and fulfills the requirements of all elements (including optional elements) of the TCK</em>….” 

    * GlassFish is a bottleneck for us now since it is the only implementation that implements all optional elements. For the future, we need to get rid of the optional parts, or allow for composite CCRs
    * Suggestion to drop CMP/BMP parts from platform spec
    * For Jakarta EE 11: Remove all optional parts 

### TCK Status
* Platform passing GF
* Web Profile failing signature tests due to [needing Concurrency jar](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/23963)
* BV TCK runner needs an update still
    * [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/bvtck-porting/job/master/166/#showFailuresLink](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/bvtck-porting/job/master/166/#showFailuresLink) shows 6 failures
* CDI TCK runner needs update as it sees failures
    * https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/cditck-porting/
* Core Profile passing WF
* Standalone TCKs:
    * concurrency?
