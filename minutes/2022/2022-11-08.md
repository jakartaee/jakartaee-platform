## Agenda and Minutes

### Faces Challenges: next steps
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1701](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1701) (3 failures)  (accepted, test engineers accidentally used/kept Mojarra specific things here)
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1702](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1702) (5 failures) (accepted, test engineers accidentally used/kept Mojarra specific things here)
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1703](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1703) (3 failures) (accepted, test engineers accidentally used/kept Mojarra specific things here)
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1704](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1704) (1 failure, accepted, update the test)
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1705](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1705) (8 failures) (accepted, will also be clarified in Faces.Next)
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1710](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1710) (2 failures) (accepted, will remove test)
* If possible to update in timely fashion; update tests and provide service release, otherwise just exclude all (no very big impact on overall coverage)

### Security challenges: next steps
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/273](https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/273) (2 failures, accepted, update the tests)
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/275](https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/275) (1 failure, exclude test)
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/276](https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/276) (1 failure, exclude test)
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/277](https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/277) (openid, 2 failures)
    * Open ID challenge - if possible at all, update test, not exclude. Otherwise coverage drops dramatically.

### TCK challenges and certification
* Should a TCK challenge accepted must resolve a service release and then a runtime can certify against the service release?
    * We can discuss this in the process among Jakarta Spec committee

### How to get TCK releases out and any committer should be able to do it
* Faces - Arjan will dig out the instruction 
* Document the CI jobs in each github repo wiki
* Emily: Write a Google doc to document what we want to see in each project.
* Scott: CDI has wiki to document CI
* Platform TCK wiki is out of date but is at https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-TCK-Jenkins-jobs
