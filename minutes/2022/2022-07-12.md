## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* CDI Language Model TCK
    * Glassfish fixed the issue 

* CCR submitted for GlassFish and the full profile: [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/514](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/514)
    * Comments on mailing list
    * Updates required for some links to TCKs and matching SHA values
        * Faces
            * PR for updating spec page - done
            * TCK must be moved/signed from promoted to main download 
            * Ed will help out with this
        * Authentication
            * 4.0.0 or 4.0.1?
            * Push the 4.0.1 TCK file, or update the CCR links
        * Activation
            * CCR based on staged TCK
            * SHA does not match the published TCK
            * Arjan will update the result page for GlassFish, check with Lukas
        * REST
            * Broken links
            * PR to be merged 

* Concurrency TCK results are still failing on Web Profile as per [TCK results wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-results#date--2022-07-11-and-2022-07-12)
    * Open issue [https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/244](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/244)
    * Pull request [https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/250](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/250)
    * Current consensus is to include the test. On mailing list.
    * Next step: Approve PR, merge, build and stage new TCK
    * Run TCK with GlassFish 

* Core Profile: Jakarta REST TCK (with Jakarta XML Binding)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1109](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1109)  \

* Core Profile TCK
    * Arquillian Servlet support require full Servlet support on the server under test
    * Servlet is not part of Core Profile
    * Running the Core Profile TCK on a runtime without Servlet cause the majority of tests to fail
    * Work-around by enabling servlet kind of defeats the purpose
    * **Action**: Open Liberty team to create TCK issue for eliminating use of Servlet in Core Profile.
        * May require changes in Arquillian, or could be solved by an Adapter (hosted at EE4J?)
    * **Action**: CDI Lite TCK also depends on Servlet, Open Liberty passed but only due to adding Servlet api/impl to what they were testing.  Open Liberty team to create Core Profile TCK issue for this. 

* Example of CDI TCK test:

```
@SpecVersion(spec = "cdi", version = "2.0")
public class BeanContainerTest extends AbstractTest {

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    @Deployment
    public static WebArchive createTestArchive() {
        return new WebArchiveBuilder().withTestClassPackage(BeanContainerTest.class)
                .withClasses(RetentionLiteral.class, TargetLiteral.class).build();
    }

    @Test
    @SpecAssertion(section = BM_RESOLVE_AMBIGUOUS_DEP, id = "a")
    public void testAmbiguousDependencyResolved() {
        Set<Bean<?>> beans = getCurrentBeanContainer().getBeans(Food.class);
        assertEquals(beans.size(), 2);
        Bean<?> bean = getCurrentBeanContainer().resolve(beans);
        assertNotNull(bean);
        assertTrue(bean.isAlternative());
        assertTrue(typeSetMatches(bean.getTypes(), Food.class, Soy.class, Object.class));
    }
}
```

### Servlet Lite suggestion
* Discuss on the Servlet list?
* For future releases, not for Jakarta EE 10
