### [Emily] Package naming convention for TCKs?

* Packages for TCK starts with various names, e.g. org.ibm, org.jboss, org.eclipse, jakarta.[spec].tck etc

* Should they be standardized? 

* Concensus about the following:
    * Two things need naming standard:
        * Packages
            * Suggested Naming Standard: **jakarta.tck.[spec] **
            * New classes in existing TCKs **should** use the new name standard
        * Artifacts
            * Same group id as the spec
            * Artifact ids [foo]-tck
    * Existing TCKs may change if they like
    * New TCKs **must** use the new name standard \

* Emily will send the suggestion it to the mailing list(s) to get input

### [Jan] Dependency graph tooling 

* During the iJUG Cyberland Code Camp an experiment with JQAssistant analysing Jakarta EE 9 dependencies including a generated one for Java SE (with Dirk Mahler and Gerd Aschemann). Further analysis is planned.
