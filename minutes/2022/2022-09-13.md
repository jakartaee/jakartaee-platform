## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Platform and Web Profile Ballots
* Ivar concluded the ballots this morning US time.
* Scott will release all of the api jars together with core profile.

### More retrospective items?
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform)

### XML Binding 4.0 TCK Challenge for 16 tests failing due to www.w3.org redirect from http to https) 
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-tck/issues/78](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-tck/issues/78).
* GlassFish 7 M8 (and other implementations) were passing until [www.w3.org](www.w3.org) added the `http` redirect.  
* Not much to discuss other than call for a quick resolution of the jaxb-tck/issues/78 challenge so implementations can pass the identified 16 tests.
    * Lukas:  it would be better to fix the tests rather than hide the problem by excluding the tests, even if it takes more time.
    * Emily: A spec committee exception would be needed to change the tests.
    * It would be better to change the tests from http to https
    * How to fix the problem and also get the certification going                     through without being delayed for a long time?
        * Doing a DNS working might be tricky for some other runtime.
        * Next step: ask for permission from the Spec committee for tests update. [Emily]
* Affects XML Binding 3.0 TCK as well.
* Other TCKs that deal with XML somehow might be impacted as well.
    * We should run other TCKs again as well.

### Security TCK release or acceptance of [https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/270](https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/270)
* Exception approval ballot is in progress and will be concluded this weekend.

### Rest challenges
* Incorrect use of final in application: [https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1126](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1126)
    * Exception approval ballot is in progress and will be concluded this weekend.
    * PR not created yet
* JavaSE tests made optional: [https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1128](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1128)
    * Workaround is to not run the tests and is acceptable.

### Conclusion for challenges
* If the tests are excluded or modified by the reported to pass, this should enable a particular runtime to certify.
