* Discussion
    * No progress yet on these issues this week
    * Emily will follow up with Arjan to see how we can get them moving \

### Certification Requests awaiting approval

* [Issues · eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform (github.com)](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acertification)

* Is there a way to automate?
    * Run action that validates
    * Can be hardcoded SHA values for each release
        * Or download the TCK zip and run sha256sum
    * Simple bash script?
    * Passed number of tests are not validated by us, that is the implementor’s responsibility
    * Create a wiki page that has the steps for validating, Ed and Ed will take care of this.

### Relationship between Microprofile and Jakarta EE (based on the JWT discussion)

* [Suggestion for general guiding principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/158-XDjNGyVm2Qsgsekj1LftQk_1OKYJeOi33qOtHJ84/edit?usp=sharing)

* Discussion summary
    * Differentiate between dependencies on individual specifications and profiles
    * Remove Principle b) since it is already covered by a)
    * Add principle for where to put new specifications

* Topic for further discussion:
    * Consider allowing MP specifications in Core Profile without namespace change

### How to get TCK releases out and any committer should be able to do it

* Faces - Arjan will dig out the instruction 

* Document the CI jobs in each github repo wiki
    * Create an issue in each specification project to request documentation for their TCK CI Jobs. Creat a couple to start with
    * Provide information about how to create a service release of their TCK

* Emily: Write a Google doc to document what we want to see in each project.
    * The document describes how to document the jobs on the project wiki
    * Establish a pattern/naming convention for CI jobs. Do we have a good example? MVC: [Jakarta MVC - Dashboard [Jenkins] (eclipse.org)](https://ci.eclipse.org/mvc/) 
    * Emily will put it in the shared drive
    * Nice to have versioning via folders, for example see https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/10/

* Scott: CDI has wiki to document CI

* Platform TCK wiki is out of date but is at https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-TCK-Jenkins-jobs
