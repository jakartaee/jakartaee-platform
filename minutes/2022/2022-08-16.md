## Agenda and Minutes



### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* Glassfish passing concurrency test if they run separately from the Platform test
* We need someone from Glassfish to confirm testing had passed and to submit results
    * noone from Concurrency team is available to confirm this, but looking at all seems to be ready
    * https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-results
* Service Release Concurrency 3.0.2 TCK
    * TCK to Staging
    * Glassfish will rerun the TCK
    * TCK to Central
    * If also an API version 3.0.2 will be created, then Jan will do a PR for the Web Profile to pick it up
    * Repo -  3.0.2 TCK not staged
