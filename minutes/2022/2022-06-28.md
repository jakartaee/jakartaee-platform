## Agenda and Minutes

### Have 10 min interruption for Jakarta EE 10 release party call around 10 min mark
* Ivar and Scott have to drop of for about 10 mins

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)
   
    * Core profile updates to tck to remove untagged xml binding tests and security related tests
        * Done using junit5 suite and extension class
    * Concurrency tck has an issue running under web profile implementation due to remote ejb usage (and ears?)
        * Can’t use the same approach because the tck tests are bundled into one deployment
        * Use of org.jboss.arquillian.container.test.spi.client.deployment.ApplicationArchiveProcessor may be able to workaround deployment failures
        * Update a point release of TCK or somehow exclude tests in the runner?
        * Contains remote EJBs then glassfish will fail to deploy the app.
            * Some are not in EARs for remote EJBs (contained in WARs)
        * Long term effort to center concurrency away from EJB/jndi etc.  More on CDI
        * A TCK challenge issue is needed for the EJB deployment failure on [https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues)
        * PATH forward is to see about modifying tests for local EJB usage
    * Glassfish has passed various standalone tcks (for full profile), but seems like there are few regressions to sort out
    * Close but no cigar to being ready to go to ballot
    * DI and Debug have some issues to work out for running on Web Profile
    * [CDI Hack test run](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/10/job/cdihacktest/9/) passes but the [CI job we are using](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/cditck-porting/job/master/211/) fails.
        * [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/cditck-porting/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/cditck-porting/) needs to download needed jars instead of building them.
    * [EE 9.1 CCR link](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/pull/23458) for GlassFish 6.1 

### What is the point of [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-schemas](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-schemas)?

* We have a fraction of the schemas there
    * It cannot be the true source as spec projects are where they are maintained and produced
    * Stuff gets moved to [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee)

* Comment from Ivar:
    * The jakartaee-schemas repository contains the source of all schemas under the “jakartaee” namespace as XML Schema Definition source files (.xsds)
    * When built (which also tests for validity), the schemas (.xsd) are (manually) published to [https://jakarta.ee/schemas](https://jakarta.ee/schemas) following this [process](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/publish-xml-schemas).

### Some discussion on EE 11 starting
* CDI
* Faces
