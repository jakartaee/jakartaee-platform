## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* Work continues on TCKs

* Enterprise-beans module-info: [https://github.com/jakartaee/enterprise-beans/pull/141](https://github.com/jakartaee/enterprise-beans/pull/141)

* Still need draft PRs:
    * Jakarta Messaging 3.1 - Has RC, no issues remaining?
    * Jakarta JSON Binding 3.0 - TCK?
        * Working on small issue with platform TCK
        * Only remaining issue
        * On track for Feb 28
    * Jakarta Authorization 2.1 - 2 issues that do not seem to be addressable for EE10 at this point.
    * Jakarta Standard Tag Library 3.0 - Resolving last issues
    * Jakarta Connectors 2.1 - RC put out, seems to be one spec related issue
    * Jakarta Security 3.0 - Created issue to triage remaining issues into an EE10 set
        * https://github.com/jakartaee/security/issues/205
    * Jakarta Faces 4.0 - working on TCK

* Action item for all spec projects: Create the draft PR and release (milestones) of API artifacts \

### TCK Packaging

* Release of JAR to Maven Central?

* How to “track” this file? List SHA-1 (as is used by Maven Central)?

* Spec committee only track the ZIP file (with SHA256)
    * This signed binary must be referenced when implementations claim compatibility

* Jsonp tck provides zip 

* For EE 10, the current requirement of producing a ZIP file with associated SHA-256 stands

* Action: 
    * Check with EF if releasing TCK artifacts dual licensed (EFTL+EPL2) to Maven Central is ok (Ivar)
    * ZIP file has EFTL only today. Is it ok to publish EFTL-only licensed artifacts to Maven Central?

* Get clarifications on next spec committee call
    * Scott will draft a proposal 
    * Jakarta EE TCK process may have to be updated \
