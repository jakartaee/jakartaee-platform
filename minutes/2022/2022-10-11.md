* Need to discuss with Lukas (Activation) for the overall discussion. Will be present on the call next week.
* Is it possible to resolve the challenge faster? Continue conversation on the GitHub issue. Escalate according to TCK process if needed.
* Should it be an associated challenge to the Platform TCK as well?
    * No, there is no challenge with Platform TCK.
* Create an issue to track the changes needed to the wiki

### Java SE poll form
* [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pFOqM4ykjQSQ78UrXqXLlu6e9WgZ7Flzp9kU4AW-4sc/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pFOqM4ykjQSQ78UrXqXLlu6e9WgZ7Flzp9kU4AW-4sc/edit) 
* Usage vs requirement for features
* Please provide feedback on the poll questions. 
* Plan to send out the poll after next call
* On 10.1 question, if security manager is removed from TCK tests, that only helps on JVMs (or implementations) using lazy classloaders (otherwise CNFEs may occur for security manager spec api).
* Can we get clarity on how the Security Manager will actually be removed? E.g. replaced with no-ops etc.

### Jakarta EE. Next further discussion
* [Googledoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-dkvbL0iFFzitO4vt1SVq6GGSJyFdCDM2NU_FzGS10/edit#heading=h.1oyn459kodrn)
