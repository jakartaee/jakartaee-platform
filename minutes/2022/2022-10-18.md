## Agenda and Minutes

### [Emily] JPMS required for Jakarta Activation and Jakarta Mail even though Jakarta EE clearly documented that it is optional:
*  [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaf/issues/98](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaf/issues/98)
    * Discussed the challenge. Will be accepted, and tests modified to allow for differentiating between SE and EE runs (as described by Lukas in the comments in the challenge)
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mail/issues/625](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mail/issues/625)
    * Same as above 

### Result of EE 10.1 poll

* A Jakarta EE Minor Release (10.1) that drops support for Java SE 11 violates semver rules - it’s a breaking change. [Jan]
* Dropping Java SE 11 support could be done in a major release (Jakarta 11). [Jan]
* Discussion on the [platform dev mailing list ](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/2022/Oct/index.html)regarding a 10.1 release created the idea to have a mandatory (timed?) Milestone for dropping SE 11 and adding 18+ support on component specs (requiring addressing the SecurityManager removal) [Jan]
* Suggestion: When there is a PR with the proposed changes, a Jakarta EE 10.1 release can be considered if it doesn’t take away time/resources from Jakarta EE 11
* Questioning the approach with polls from individuals
    * Valid data points
    * Limited outreach
    * Specific audience
    * No context for the options (no pros or cons)
* Should be restrictive updating base Java version without specific technical requirements/requests from the specifications
