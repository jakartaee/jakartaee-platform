## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)
* Jakarta Security 3.0 status
    * Waiting for the ballot to be restarted. Jean-Louis is on it.
    * Scott will ping Arjan
* Jakarta Servlet 6.0 API publish to maven status
    * Any committer on Servlet is encouraged to run the release from staging to central CI job (Jenkins)
* May be a service release of the API jar for Faces (4.0.1)
    * When done, a PR is needed to update the Platform-/Web Profile API jars \

* Core Profile PR ([https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/495](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/495))
    * Question about copyright date (spec doc)?
        * 2018-2022 or 2021-2022
            * Use the single year it is published (ratified). I.e. **2022**
                * Inception year, current year
        * Why is the copyright date coming from the license-efsl.adoc file?
            * Will refactor the copyright out to a separate file so we are able to differentiate between the profile specifications
    * JavaDoc (pom file)
        * Use 2018, 2022 for JavaDoc \
