    * Tracking issue is [https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi-tck/issues/392](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi-tck/issues/392)

* Platform
    * TCKs passed with glassfish so far
    * Concurrency TCK: with the [new PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/245), Glassfish will get 9 test failures
        * Separate to different groups lost the migration. Only got caught in April

    * Failures with remote EJB, ear package 
        * Issue: [https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/244](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/244)
            * Scott Stark reduced the failures but there are still failures
            * Still 8 test failures
            * No server log from glassfish attached.
            * Change is not complete. The [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/245) will cause platform regression but the change is not complete as yet.
            * Who will complete the PR? When ? who?
