* The JakartaRPC[ IC](https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/attachment.cgi?id=30538) is approved but check in to [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/rpc](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/rpc) is ‘overdue’: See Maria’s comments on [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/emo/-/issues/111](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/emo/-/issues/111)

### Jakarta EE Release Guidance
* Draft: [Jakarta EE Release Guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e2JOhUVUpFSwUamDok2D16sXWsQqVRUiXq-fmnOI-ow/edit#heading=h.x6m6k1m2wn2u)
* All projects should link to their documentation (wiki) from their CI like CDI does
* Also check out the naming standard used by Security, Servlet, Faces, [Mojarra](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/blob/master/RELEASE.md), Soteria and others
* The naming conventions should at least be used for new specifications when they set up their jobs
* Emily will update the Platform Wiki with the naming conventions: [Home · eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform Wiki (github.com)](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/wiki)
* Continue working on this next year
* Suggestion: A way to filter out/identify the Jakarta related CI instances on [Eclipse CI | The Eclipse Foundation](https://ci.eclipse.org/) would be great! Emily will file an issue with Eclipse Infra.
    * [Ticket](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2397) created
