## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* Continuing work on TCKs at both component and platform/profile levels
* Begin more work on updating the platform/profile specifications this week
* TCK status on the spec committee call tomorrow
* Core Profile TCK
    * Run the TCKs for the individual specifications
    * Documentation must be written (TCK User Guide)
    * What about integration tests?
        * Agreement that we need this
        * A binary must pass these in order to pass Core Profile
    * Passing TCK for Platform and/or Web Profile does not automatically imply that Core Profile is passed as well
    * Core requirement should list the TCKs + container name (previously known as vehicle)
    * AI: Scott Stark look at core profile integration issues around Jakarta RESTful Web Services dependency on a web container
    * CDI full or CDI lite only as requirement?

### Discussion Topic for Later (after EE 10)

* Should Core Profile always be a subset of Web Profile?
* Or should we allow them to diverge?
* General TCK requirements \
Reference all of the dependent spec TCK tests (current situation)? \
Ability to reference them partly?
* TCK Refactoring effort involving more contributors
    * Volunteers are welcome

### Naming discussion

* What is the rules for voting for changing names
* Rules for singular vs. plural form
* Existing Eclipse Wiki (needs update): [https://wiki.eclipse.org/JakartaEE_Maven_Versioning_Rules](https://wiki.eclipse.org/JakartaEE_Maven_Versioning_Rules)

### Core Profile in general:

* Define target “market”/functionally/scope i.e.:
    * Minimal micro service
    * Native implementation
