## Agenda and Minutes

### Define Top Level Objectives for Jakarta EE NEXT

* Mail from Steve: [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03677.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg03677.html) 
    * [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-dkvbL0iFFzitO4vt1SVq6GGSJyFdCDM2NU_FzGS10/edit?usp=sharing) for objectives gathering

* CDI Centric
    * What would be the requirement for optional specs (Jakarta XML WS as an example)?
    * Define requirements for the component specifications 
        * A topic for the first Monthly call
        * Will we be able to have a proposal ready for Nov 1?
        * Create an issue in the platform issue tracker - Scott Stark
        * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/552](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/552)

* Java SE Level
    * Decide on platform SE level for EE 11
    * Topic for the monthly call
    * Create an issue for raising language level to 17
    * Should be able to run the TCK with 21 (assuming that is the latest LTS when EE 11 is released) 

* Aim for an 10.1 to support Java SE 21 support?
    * The current TCK will not work with anything beyond SE 19
    * Suggestion: point release (10.1) for service releases, minor updates, support SE 21. Major release (11) with major updates, raising the SE level.
        * Allows for faster pace
        * Only the platform/profiles develop multiple releases simultaneously 
        * Component specs would only work on one version at a time. Either a minor or major 

* Security Manager
    * [Create issue (epic) for how to handle removal of Security Manger](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/551)
    * Eager classloading JVMs might have more issues
    * Will likely affect at least some specs
    * Will definitely affect the TCK 

* Prepare for virtual threads
    * Create an issue (epic) to cover all related to virtual threads
    * E.g. avoid using ThreadLocal
        * Is this more of an implementation issue? (which could be handled by Multi-Release JARs unlike the API) 

* Are there any specifications that are candidates for removal from platform or any of the profiles in EE 11? 

### Question – should we host a recurring meeting for all committers and/or project leads to discuss management/technical specific topics of general nature? (Ed)
* Once a month?
* Use a first meeting of the month (platform call) 
    * Make sure the agenda of the general meeting does not depend on attendants having attended the weekly meetings
    * Prepare **agenda** ahead 
    * Special invites/encouragement to specific teams depending on topic
    * First of this kind is November 1st
* Purpose of the meeting:
    * Communicate what’s going on in the Platform to the project
    * Give project opportunity to communicate back
    * Grow the committer community
    * General monthly meeting may encourage more participation
    * Communicate objectives
    * Offer help
    * General presentations
* Separate calendar invite with separate agenda - Ivar will create
* Communicate (blogs, tweets, newsletters, email etc) - all
