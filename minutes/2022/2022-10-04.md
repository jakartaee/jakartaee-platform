## Agenda and Minutes

### Baseline Java SE Level
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/553](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/553) 
* Discussion around levels
* Suggestion to use Java SE 17 for API language level
* Specifications without changes won’t need to be recompiled with SE 17
* Support 17 and 21 for runtimes (TCK must be possible to run with both)
* Run a poll for the specification projects 
    * Who’s planning for 21 features?
    * Would a EE 10.1 be interesting (with SE 17 minimum or add SE 21 support)?
    * [Run a Java SE feature poll for EE 11](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/561) 

### SecurityManager removal
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/551](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/551) 
* Need to get an overview of which specifications that are affected by the SecurityManager removal
    * Authorization (explicit use of policies)
    * Authentication
    * Security
    * TCKs
    * ..
* Merge the three security specifications into one specification **project**? Still to be released as three separate specifications. Today Security and Authn in Web Profile and Authz in Platform
* Need to understand/know how Security Manager removal will be done in SE 21 

### CDI Centric
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/552](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/552) 
* Write down implications/requirements for specification projects
    * What they can/cannot do
* Map Gaps
    * Injection mechanisms used etc.
    * Concurrency based on JNDI
    * Context propagation
    * Servlet
* EJB Features
    * Singleton Bean (ApplicationScoped in CDI + locking from EJB)
    * Drop EJB, or EJB as CDI Beans?
* CDI features that are “owned” by other specifications
    * E.g. HttpServletRequest must be made injectable by the Servlet spec
    * Optional for non-CDI containers (e.g. Jetty)
    * @Transactional now owned by the Transactions specification, but inconsistently UserTransaction injected is specified by the CDI spec
