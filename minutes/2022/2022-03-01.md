## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* All component specs have produced at least a draft PR.

* Notified spec leads that next date is **May 15** to have started release ballot

* **May 31** is target deadline for completing platform specs and TCKs

* Need to verify version references in jakartaee-api are updated to final versions

* At least 4 component specs should be ready for final release ballots

### SecurityManager Deprecated for Removal ([JEP 411](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/411))

* [TCK issue for](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/issues/743) changing SM tests to be optional (note:TCK doesn’t start SM). 

* How to handle future certification requests with Java versions where SM has been removed

* Eager classloading concern with referencing SM classes and seeing failures due to classloading failure?
    * Depends on which classes are removed by JEP 411

* JEP 411 states:
    * “[Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee) has several requirements on the Security Manager. We assume that these requirements will be relaxed or removed in order for compliant applications to run on future Java releases after the Security Manager is degraded and then removed.”

* Action: Reach out to the Java team, voice concerns. Especially around the doPrivileged-method (ensure that it will become a no-op and not completely removed). Create an issue in the OpenJDK issue tracker 

### Simplify by merging specs/projects? [suggested by Arjan on the mailing list)

* Candidates:
    * Jakarta Mail and Jakarta Activation
    * Jakarta Pages and Jakarta (Standard) Tags
    * Jakarta Security, Jakarta Authentication and Jakarta Authorization
    * Jakarta Dependency Injection and Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection and Jakarta Interceptors
    * Jakarta XML Binding, Jakarta SOAP with Attachments, Jakarta XML Web Services
    * JSON-P and JSON-B

* Merging Projects could be a first step to reduce overhead where that is a problem today

* **Should be cautious merging specs, unless they are _always_ implemented together**

* Reminder that introducing optionality is not allowed by the spec committee 

* Unable to run standalone TCKs in JSON-B from application servers as they are junit tests 
    * Continue ongoing discussion on mailing list
