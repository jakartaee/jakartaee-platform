## Agenda and Minutes

### Challenges (follow-up from last week)

* Service releases for Faces and Security to address the TCK challenges planned for later this week.
    * Faces team looking for help to resolve issues related to challenges

* New challenges opened since last week
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1714](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1714)
        * Signature test failure caused by `bindings` field not removed as expected.
        * `bindings` field is already deprecated [https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/4.0/apidocs/jakarta/faces/component/uicomponent](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/4.0/apidocs/jakarta/faces/component/uicomponent)
            * `protected Map<String,jakarta.el.ValueExpression> Bindings` Deprecated.
        * The `bindings` field can only be removed in a major Faces release. A PR should be created to remove the field from the faces api (Mojarra).
        * The Faces Spec team could approve that implementations could be considered compatible even if they don’t have the `bindings` field.
        * A goal going forward is to split the Faces API out from Mojarra. Not an insignificant amount of work.
            * Could Mojarra be moved in under Jakarta and effectively be the API (and a compatible implementation) as on JAR?
            * Today, the Faces JAR is generated from the Mojarra project and published separately.
        * APIs: [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/tree/master/impl/src/main](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/tree/master/impl/src/main)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1715](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1715)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1716](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1716)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1717](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1717) (accepted)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1718](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1718)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1722](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1722) 

* Merge of [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/579](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/579) for Servlet + Platform TCK 
    * We can merge as issues raised were addressed.
