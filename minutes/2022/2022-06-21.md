        * [https://github.com/jtulach/netbeans-apitest/pull/12](https://github.com/jtulach/netbeans-apitest/pull/12) 
    * Concurrency TCK failures
        * Discussion is going well, passing ~166 tests and failing 10 tests and looking into why.
    * CDI/BV TCK failures still on GlassFish TCK runners
        * Scott Marlow to create new CDI CI job on Platform TCK.
            * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tree/master/appserver/tests/tck/cdi](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tree/master/appserver/tests/tck/cdi) - this is what Arjan used to pass TCK
        * Scott Stark will look at Bean Validation job 

* Ed will create a PR to remove version numbers from the table that lists all of the technologies in the specification document

* Concurrency 3.0.0 API issue with test dependencies
    * Jan will create an issue for it [https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/234](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/234) 
    * Jan will create an PR for it [https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/235](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/235) and [https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/236](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/236) 

* Is there a service release for Jakarta Authentication TCK coming soon?
    * Arjan will do this as soon as possible after the Concurrency issues are solved
    * This update does not block the release ballot. Can be done later.
    * Platform TCK team needs to run the (staged old style test) Standalone Authentication TCK bundle against GlassFish 
        * The new Authentication TCK service release has not been created yet and we donâ€™t need to block EE 10 to validate that GlassFish passes the Javatest harness (old) TCK tests.
