## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* Concurrency TCK status?
    * Open Liberty passes concurrency TCK with Web Profile and Full Platform?
        * Yes
    * GlassFish [issue](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/24059) + [Concurrency issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/263)?
        * Not really sure if fixing the Concurrency issue will mean GlassFish passes.
        * GlassFish failure is at [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/10/job/jakarta-concurrency-tck-glassfish-run-jdk17/org.glassfish$glassfish.concurrency-tck/22/testReport/junit/ee.jakarta.tck.concurrent.spec.ManagedExecutorService.resourcedef/ManagedExecutorDefinitionWebTests/testCopyCompletableFutureEJB/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/10/job/jakarta-concurrency-tck-glassfish-run-jdk17/org.glassfish$glassfish.concurrency-tck/22/testReport/junit/ee.jakarta.tck.concurrent.spec.ManagedExecutorService.resourcedef/ManagedExecutorDefinitionWebTests/testCopyCompletableFutureEJB/)
    * WildFly has a challenge
        * May be the same as GlassFish experienced (above)?
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/263](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/263)
            * Might not the same as the GF issue
        * James will post more information on the issue shortly 

    * **Web Profile and Platform ballots waiting on this** 

* Concurrency API version need to be fixed in Web Profile (and so in the Full Profile) - 3.0.1 instead of 3.0.0.

    * Scott Marlow to revert the core tck part of the commit. 

* Core Profile in ballot
    * Tracking [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/issues/1096](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/issues/1096) still.  Making progress on it though.  New rest-jakarta protocol added to arquillian.  1.7.0.Alpha11 release created.  Tracking [https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-core/issues/418](https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-core/issues/418) for fix to possibly be in Alpha12 release.
