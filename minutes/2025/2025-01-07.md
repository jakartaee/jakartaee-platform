## Agenda

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* Ed has requested help from Will Lyons from the Steering Committee to have an intervention to get the new Jakarta EE 11 TCK completed so we can be done with EE 11\. Will has agreed and is planning to attend the TCK call tomorrow.  
  * There is a chance that some of our previously discarded “hybrid 10+11” type options may be put back under consideration. I strongly don’t want to be dealing with this in EE 12, so I ask Scott Marlow to give some thought to why those options are undesirable.  
* Ed hasn’t completed his assigned action items regarding releasing the core profile maven artifacts for the TCK in a compliant way with the specification committee guidance. This task is still assigned to Ed.  
  * \[Ivar\] The Core API artifacts were released right after the ballot concluded successfully according to the process.  
    [https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/jakarta.platform/jakarta.jakartaee-core-api](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/jakarta.platform/jakarta.jakartaee-core-api)  
  * \[Ivar\] The Spec page has not been updated  ([PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/782) has not been merged yet).   
    * The reason the PR has not been merged is that the TCK release has not complied with the new requirement.  
    * The decision to not comply with the new requirement is within the authority of the platform project.  
      * The platform project proposes we publish the TCK zip as is and follow a manual process to extract the TCK maven artifacts and publish them to maven central. See [comment on PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/782#issuecomment-2575717225).

### TCK Refactoring Jakarta EE 11

* Arjan provided an update. In his telling, the TCK structure is still in a bit of disarray. More organization is necessary.  
  * Code that is not on the critical path for releasing EE 11 is still present in the TCK. This code should be moved to component TCK tests. For example, some Tags tests.  
* Discussion about test placement from Jan:

  I think for the allocation of tests in the Component or Platform TCK should follow their test dependency requirements \- if they need to add dependencies beyond their Spec and API dependencies, then they need to be placed separately in the component spec as a minimum or must be part of the Platform TCK.  
  The Component Spec TCK should support different environments like Java SE, Core Profile, Web profile and Platform \- or even something like Servlet Container (only).  
     
  Some of these dependency issues might be solved by moving the test from a lower wave component spec TCK to a higher wave component spec TCK instead of putting it into the Platform TCK.


### Jakarta EE 11

* Authentication 3.1.1 TCK update  
  * 3.1.1 is staged and is set to be promoted with [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/790](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/790)  
  * ACTION: Ivar to merge and run promotion script  
  * ~~Couple of updates requested to the PR before merging~~  
       
* Servlet 6.1.1 TCK update  
  * 6.1.1 is staged and set to be promoted with [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/791](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/791)  
  * Looks like some updates needed to the PR before merging it.  Phu is working it.

* Validation 3.1 API  
  * Validation implementation cannot go final until some files are added / updated in the API jar.    
  * When will we get a new 3.1.1 release of the API?  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/pull/221](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/pull/221) appears to be the PR that is needed for a 3.1.1 updated API artifact  
    * ACTION: Ed to chase down Validation committer to get this merged.

### Jakarta EE 12

* Reza has a solid, action-oriented and specific plan to make EE 12 more compelling. See it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2qEqF9K969t5b3YuX4cwex5LJPvF3bt1w27cdKNpDM/edit?tab=t.0). The plan includes hyperlinks to GitHub issues for the respective component specifications. Please apply the label **EE12** to each of these.  
* ACTION: What about merging authorization, authentication and security into one spec? There is no opposition to this. It can be done any time **after EE 11** is out.
