## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* OSGi versioning is a bit of a mess - anything we can really do for EE10?
    * AI, Scott will ask if CDI is ok with trying out OSGi annotations, if so, create issue to investigate usage the BJ will take on
    * Most likely punting on this issue until EE11 for most specs

* TCK status?
    * https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/jakartaee-tck/jakartaee10/staged/eftl/ 
        * Includes TCKs that are expected to migrate to Standalone TCKs, like Restful Web Services
    * https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/jakartaee-tck/jakartaee10/staged/epl/
    * Some persistence tests are being added and some other technologies have tests being added via pull requests that need to be merged.
    * Documentation needs to be updated for EE 10 still.
    * 17 open issues for EE 10 https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A10.0
        * 11 issues unassigned
    * Activation tck should be considered done (need glassfish )
    * jsonp tck should be done by end of week
    * Mail tck (spec is basically ready for ballot) - one outstanding issue
    * Creating new TCK tests for persistence.
        * Target for EE 10.
