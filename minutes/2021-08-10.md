## Agenda and Minutes

### [KWS] Discuss Jakarta EE 10 Release Plan

* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U24VmTzAfXcn3WBnVcolb8vhZO-Pnk_bit0CKh_d2jM/edit?pli=1#heading=h.bzkb0r6v92il 
  * A couple of outstanding questions

* Scott Stark is good with the current state of the Release Plan.  He will post his agreement to the Google Doc questions so that we can move forward with the Jakarta EE 10 Release Plan ballot.

* Service Loader issues with Module definitions.  Not part of the Jakarta EE 10 proposal.  This will need to be addressed in a future release.  For now, this will be implementation specific.

* (Lukas will research and file issues) Create a list of specifications with custom service loaders. These should be marked as obsolete and switched to JDK provided service loaders.

* Kevin will do a final “edit” pass and initiate the plan review ballot. Probably before this meeting next week.
* (Kevin is out after Wed. next week. Scott will pick up finalization of ballot -- working with Ivar)

The meeting ended at 8:22 AM PDT
