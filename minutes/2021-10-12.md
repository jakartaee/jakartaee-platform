## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* Discussed updating module-info for API jars without release plans that want to support both Java SE 8 and Java SE 11
* Multi-release JARs? Or compile twice to produce two JARs?

### [Emily] Module-info location

* Where should the module-info.class be located? Shall the jar be a multi-release jar?
* Must be possible/easy to exclude module-info when packaged in uber-Jar 
* Summary:

   * module-info must be placed in the root of the JAR
   * The four specs from JDK 8 already support module-info: Activation, XML Binding, XML web services, SOAP attachments
   * + jsonp, mail, persistence, jsonb
   * In case a spec wants/needs to support previous versions of Java, a multi-release JAR may be required for that spec (e.g., JAXB in EE 9/9.1)
   * Multi-release JAR is not needed just for adding the module-info


### [Emily] Module-info support

* Only module-info file required, no tck provided?
* Not needed any tests for Jakarta EE 10
* Will be validated as a part of the ratification of the spec
* Add checklist for what to verify:
   * Module-info in root
   * Multi-release JAR if supporting older version 
   * etc..?
