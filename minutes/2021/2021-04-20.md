## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 9.1

* Applet references in the specification document  
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/298  
Asked Ed to take a look and see if this is required for 9.1, or can it be pushed out to 10?

* TCK
  * Update to signature tests done
  * Updated TCK will be in https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/jakartaee-tck/jakartaee9-eftl/promoted/
    * Watch for email on Platform + Platform TCK mailing list announcing TCKs are available for compatible implementations to start testing with.
  * https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/pull/707 
    * Scott will check the PR and discussion on mailing lists and Slack and follow up on this
      * PR was accepted via lazy consensus and merged, respinning the TCK builds with the same expectation of having TCKs available by Friday April 23 on https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/jakartaee-tck/jakartaee9-eftl/promoted/.

* Compatible implementations need to create their compatibility request by April 29 (by end of day in any timezone) to be included in the ballot. Amelia submitted a git issue asking Jakarta Media to be used to reach out beyond the mailing lists. 
  * Current status:
    * TomEE - on track
    * OpenLiberty - in good shape
    * WildFly - looking good
    * Eclipse GlassFish - done
