## Agenda and Minutes

### [IG] False Compatibility Certification Request?

* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/292 
* Action: Close with a comment (Ivar)

### Jakarta EE 9.1

* Changes needed in EFSP for service releases without spec committee ballot. Brought up to the Spec Committee mailing list. Work in progress.
* Anyone with an Enterprise Beans implementation is recommended to join the discussions happening on the Enterprise Beans mailing list.
* Some EE 9 implementations are including their own PortableRemoteObject for running on Java SE 11.
  * Defer making a decision on whether SPEC API should be added for PortableRemoteObject until EJB team gets more feedback from implementations.
  * Ask: Can all implementations:
    * Check to see if you ship your own copy of PortableRemoteObject.narrow
    * Is that jar separate from your ORB
    * Where did the source code come from for that?
      * Example:  https://github.com/apache/geronimo-yoko/blob/master/yoko-rmi-spec/src/main/java/javax/rmi/PortableRemoteObject.java 
    * Can you support EJB clients that use IIOP in Java 11 without requiring a PortableRemoteObject narrow call?

### [WK] Possible usage of selected MP features either on an API or Implementation level and what those MP specs would have to do

* See https://groups.google.com/g/microprofile/c/FRbC1s6b010 or page 3 of

* Discussed topic briefly
