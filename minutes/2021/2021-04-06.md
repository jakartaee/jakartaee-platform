## Agenda and Minutes (30 min call due to PMC at bottom of hour)

### Jakarta EE 9.1

* TCK related (Ed Bratt) -- Mailing list for disputes? jakarta.ee-spec.committee@eclipse.org is documented in each TCK user guide for raising disputes. This is a private list for Jakarta EE Spec Committee members and Ed believes e-mail sent to his list from outside that community, will bounce. We probably need to update this to the Public spec list (Will ask Spec. committee)
  * https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/jakarta.ee-spec is the public list.  But, with all Eclipse-based mailing lists, you need to register for the mailing list before posting.

* Add JAXB TCK for both TCKs (Ed Bratt)? (No concerns raised. Will add to rules for both Platform and Web Profile User Guide rules.)

* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A9.1

* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-tck is valid for JDK11 + JDK 8 testing, so no new JAXB TCK is needed.
  * Remove staged jaxb tck.
  * As per https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/jakarta-platform-spec-9.html#a2161, XML Binding is optional, so only implementations that support JAXB have to pass JAXB TCK.

* Waiting for a couple of PRs to be merged into GlassFish before the RC1 can be produced.

### Core Profile Proposal

* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tal7dMb6DOHBCwlecViEjPqAMTMEStoZdxTVokIVW94/edit 

* Ivar will create a PR for creation review
