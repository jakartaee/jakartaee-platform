* Questions that came up in last week’s call
  * Should we split the discussion/decision for release cadence (time- vs feature-based) and versioning scheme?
  * Should Platform/profiles be “marketing” versions while component specifications are versioned semantically?

* Discussion:

* Jan presented background slides on versioning
  * https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i4AwC7Dn4BpwvyiYlmIkDM1QYMyHTkGf/view?usp=sharing 
* Does a component spec have to release a major version when the minimum Java SE level is increased?
  * If a component specification is allowed to compile to Java SE 8, it can release a minor version
  * If a component spec compiles to Java SE 11, a major is required
  * [KWS] Note: This conclusion is inconsistent with a previous discussion pm 06/22 and CONCLUSION:
    * **CONCLUSION: As long as existing binaries still work, it’s just a minor update. Binary compatibility is preserved.**
  * Clarifying on the 07/13 call (again)...

* The platform API JAR may be a problem, especially when JPMS is introduced
  * Should we drop the uber-JAR?
  * Replace it with a BOM?
  * What about non-Maven users?
