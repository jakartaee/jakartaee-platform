(graphic as of June 22, 2021)

* Discussion regarding semantic versioning
  * Do we need to distinguish between component specifications and profiles/platform?
  * Should the platform be a marketing version? 
  * And the individual specifications semantically versioned?

* Should we take one step back and
  1. Decide on time-based vs feature-based platform/profile release cadence
  2. Then decide on versioning scheme?
  3. Also, what about the relationship between the xxxProfile and Platform versions?  

* Continue discussion on mailing list and next call
  * Jan will provide an updated presentation to Scott Stark and Ivar for the shared drive
  * He will start the conversation on the mailing list.  He offered to walk us through the presentation at our next meeting.

### JPMS

* Discussion Thread
  * https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg02632.html 
* We should require a module-info for Jakarta EE 10
  * Individual component specs as well as the Platform
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/329#issuecomment-840710785 
  * If we define all of these module-infos, they should be considered part of the respective API.  And, thus, are the signature tests also affected?
* Suggestion for EE 10
  * **Each individual spec provides a module info following a specified set of conventions:**
    * spec module name is jakarta.<specName>
    * spec provides JPMS module definition (reliance on automatic module name is not allowed)
    * spec updates provider lookup algorithm to include search on module-path (if applicable)

* **We will not provide a platform/profile level module for EE 10**
  * Donâ€™t want to set the expectation that implementations must support JPMS at this point
  * Implementations can still experiment with their own aggregator modules

* Ivar will send the text above to the mailing list (jpms thread)

### [Emily] Jakarta Annotation - who is leading the spec?

* https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.ca/who shows no project lead
* CDI spec would like this spec to make some progress
  * Dmitry will review, and merge the PRs (leaving them open for a week for comments).
  * We encourage a volunteer to sign up for the project lead position (Scott Marlow tweeted a request)
