## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* Jakarta EE 10 Wiki
   * Waves (to cope with dependencies between specs)
      * Define them for EE 10 as we did for EE 9?
      * Should be less complicated this time 
      * Ordering not as critical this time as not all specs are being released
      * [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTUpfdLZZrk2_UGwoX2w0seOCueRO3sQJIjWxpDAa7g/edit#gid=35969432)

### Removal of CORBA related APIs in EE10

* https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg02808.html 

### Security Manager	

* Should it be removed from the TCK?
* What is the negative impact of removing the tests?
* SPEC Assertion document [jakartaee/JavaEESpecAssertions.xml](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/blob/master/internal/docs/jakartaee/JavaEESpecAssertions.xml)
* Go through the spec, verify the assertions. What are they saying? Are they needed?
* The SecurityManager is deprecated in 17, not removed yet

### Remove Applet from Platform

### Updates from Specification Projects

* [Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZ8rk-Cy6sxqULecPjNFW-3SXUJ2MXtH3hoVEYlvS6w_R79w/viewform?usp=sf_link) sent to project leads
* Replies so far from Expression Language, Server Pages, WebSocket and Servlet
* Ping the mailing list again, or even the project leads directly
* **Action**: Add link to form to Wiki (ivar)

### TCK Coordination

* Tracking of staged artifacts and their SHA
* Project are encouraged to help keep the spreadsheet up-to-date
* Scott will maintain it, but ask the spec teams for help to update
* Should SHAs be automatically updated?
   * Could other aspects be of the spreadsheet be automated
   * Use Lukasâ€™s Spec script example
