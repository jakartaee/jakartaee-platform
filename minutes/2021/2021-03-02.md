## Agenda and Minutes (30 min call due to PMC at bottom of hour)

### Jakarta EE 9.1

* TCK and GF status
  * JDK 8 Full Platform still passes!
  * JDK 11 is getting more attention, some TCK issues + GF issues.
    * App client container failures, certificate failures.
    * GlassFish runs on JDK 11, passes its internal tests
    * TCK Test failures should be reported in the GF issue tracker
* EJB test references to PortableRemoteObject#narrow?
  * Vote happening on EJB Dev mailing list
  * https://www.eclipse.org/lists/ejb-dev/msg00188.html 
* EJB test references to CORBA.ORB?
  * Eager vs lazy loading of references
  * Only (Corba) optional tests can still reference the CORBA.ORB class (to avoid CNFE on eager classloading JVMs).
* Based on current status, it is likely that the release date will be pushed out to April

### Release Lead for next release (EE 9.2 or 10)

* Most likely should come from the Platform Project pool
* https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-platform/who 
* Deferred to next call

### Develop release roadmap for 2021 (versions, quarters) 

* Q1 goal of 2021 Program plan
* Identify a lead for this effort
* Deferred to next call
