    * Backward incompatible changes
    * Updated release plan is needed

### Jakarta Interceptors service release

* PR to update module-info created
* Blocks other specifications, such as CDI
* Follow up with Jakarta Interceptors project to get a release staged

### Verify TCKs on other implementations than GlassFish

* Is it each specification projectâ€™s responsibility?
* Should the platform team monitor this effort?
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/issues/762#issuecomment-948715298 
* For Jakarta EE 10, vendors must run both the standalone and the platform versions of the TCK
* The goal should be to simplify running the TCKs against vendor implementations

### Standardize the output from the TCK?

* Define a generic format (xml or json) 
* Leave it to the individual projects to produce results on this format
    * Platform test vehicles are defined here.
* Include any error output?
    * At a minimal level, include the number of test failures.
* Has the user implemented any optional technologies?
* **Action**: Create an issue in the Platform issue tracker to discuss the output format for the summary output - Ed -- See Jakarta EE Platform [#426](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/426)
* Use this to provide a recommendation to the spec committee
