## Agenda and Minutes

### [KWS] Discuss Jakarta EE 10 Release Plan

* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U24VmTzAfXcn3WBnVcolb8vhZO-Pnk_bit0CKh_d2jM/edit?pli=1#heading=h.bzkb0r6v92il 

* TCK execution with Java SE 17 as well as Java SE 11 must be possible
  * Implementations can test on 11 and newer (where newer in practice probably will be 17 in most cases)
  * Focus on the LTS releases
  * If issues running with intermediate versions occur, we will look at it case-by-case

* “Removal” Optional Features
  * Follow the decision from the spec committee
  * Remove EJB Entity Bean (BMP+CMP) and Embeddable Container features in EE 10?
    * Do we need a “paper 9.2” to deprecate them? (not being required for ratification)
    * Drop mention them in the platform spec
    * If an implementation chooses to implement them, they need to look to the EJB spec
  * Curtail the use of optional features in platform and component specs?

* Standalone Component TCKs
  * “Run-at” goal for Jakarta EE 10
  * TCK project will work with two branches for refactoring/conversion of component TCKs for future move to individual components specification project repositories
  * Integration tests will stay in the main TCK

* Proposed Updates Still under Discussion
  * Jakarta MVC 2.1 will not be added to the Web Profile for Jakarta EE 10
  * Add an introduction to the Jakarta Core Profile, but leave the detail to the eventual Core Profile release plan

* Next steps
  * Run the “optional” section through the spec committee tomorrow
  * Resolve remaining comments in the Google doc
  * Create the plan review PRs and start the ballot
