## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10

* Ballots passed
* PR for Core this week
* Communicate to spec teams the October 15 date for release reviews

### Implications of Security Manager Marked for Deprecation in Java SE 17

* https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg02744.html

* Discussion:
    * Most likely just some minor configuration changes for running some of the TCKs
    * For EE 10: Warn that next version of EE will deal with the Security Manager
    * Authorization and Authentication specs are most likely the only specs really affected - TODO: create issues for this in the spec issue trackers
    * When we want to run the EE 10 TCK on 18 and later, changes are anticipated (a service release most likely needed to solve this)
    * https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/411
        * Discussion on security-dev@openjdk.java.net

### [EJ] Semantic versioning APIs to announce whether there are major or minor or no changes in the corresponding APIs.

* Create package-info.java (see an example here) in the API packages
* Using semantic versioning plugin bnd
* Tooling to ensure that rules of semantic versioning are followed
    * Only in the class files to help the tooling (class retention annotations are runtime invisible)
* Potentially an issue with the signature tests?
    * Since the annotations are added in the actual API jars, there should not be an issue with the signature tests
* Is it ok to introduce a dependency to org.osgi.annotation.versioning.Version ?
    * What if the meaning of the annotation changes at a later stage?
    * Suggestion to create a Jakarta version of the OSGI version annotation(s) to have complete control over it?
        * Put them in the Jakarta Annotations project?
        * All other specs would then depend on Jakarta Annotations, **or**
        * Produce the artifact from e.g. the Platform project
        * No specification, just a well-documented “Build tooling project”

    * Or, use the org.osgi.* annotations?
        * MicroProfile use this tooling with success today
        * Marlow: TCK signature test could check specifically for org.osgi.* annotations that are not retained at runtime.

* OSGi Semantic Versioning Whitepaper: http://docs.osgi.org/whitepaper/semantic-versioning/
