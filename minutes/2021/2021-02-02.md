## Agenda and Minutes

### Schema discussion (continued from the last call)

* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/jakarta-platform-spec-9.html#schemas talks about requiring Jakarta EE 8 schemas in EE 9.
* Action: Add issue for component specs that refer to old schema versions
  * Related to the Broken Link Issue that the Eclipse Foundation team created:  https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/issues/318 

### [KWS] Jakarta EE 9.1 Release Plan finalization…

* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fEf-Iio2-NJSfMuNc1rpCxIMdA6tlUyv8d2c4TydMt0/edit#heading=h.6xah2gyxogbs 
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/pull/299 
* Next steps…  Get endorsement from Steering Committee and initiate a public ballot for the Specification Committee (and interested parties)
* Ensure we have a Jakarta EE 9.1 release record in the Eclipse Pages.
* Fujitsu working on Java SE 11 support for GlassFish

### Ken Fogel asked when to expect support fort newer Java versions, e.g. Java 17

* This would be a requirement for a post-9.1 release (either 9.2 or 10).  We need to get past this initial hurdle of supporting Java SE 8 and 11.

### [WK] Impact of using selected MP features by Jakarta implementations of NoSQL

* (where JNoSQL is already impacted) or say Krazo 2.x if it was to use MP REST Client or something else. The usage in specs is currently out of discussions unless the JESP was updated accordingly (jakartaee/JESP/issues/5)
  * Would it be acceptable and also in the interest of “Cloud Native” or “Lean” if an implementation had to carry the overhead of Jakarta EE 9.1, 10 or higher plus at least one earlier version like Jakarta EE 8 because the MP dependencies are not yet there?
