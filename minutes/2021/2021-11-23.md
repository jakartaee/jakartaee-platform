* 23 votes in total so far
* Cast your vote if you havenâ€™t done so yet
* All options can be reviewed in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15MM8tX1sS_i5OacrgZZPmkT8WVamQkkziLChVVopOPw/edit#heading=h.3b2e4zn311bp).
* The free version of Surveymonkey is causing some problems
* Look at using the EF SurveyMonkey in later surveys. Or something else? Google Forms is an option.

### Jakarta Batch / CDI vote ongoing as well

* 40 responses can be accessed so far with a free account
* See this [e-mail](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakarta.ee-community/msg02822.html) in jakarta.ee-community list for details about the Batch poll.

### Jakarta namespace issue

* GroupId and ArtifactId for javax-versions and jakarta-versions are the same
* This cause problems for projects that need to use both

```
<groupId>jakarta.jms</groupId>
<artifactId>jms-api</artifactId>
<version>2.0.0</version> # javax-version
<version>3.0.0</version> #jakarta-version
```

* Proposed Solutions
    * Option 1: release a new official version of the javax-version to Maven Central (requires maven coordinate naming that prevent confusion)
    * Option 2: the project that needs it creates its own version of the api-jar (repackaging)

* Option 1 seems to be the most popular
* A naming convention should be defined
    * Avoid confusion
    * Avoid javax
    * Use a classifier?
    * Tomas will send a proposal on the mailing list

### Initial committers for the Jakarta Commons project proposal are wanted!

* Google Doc with the proposal circulate on mailing lists(s)
    * https://docs.google.com/document/d/19eN3pQxtoMNoiqEKasPzbuTjUcYBC4pS0TGT12lVE3Y/edit?usp=sharing

### Jakarta gRPC (working name) also looking for initial committers

### A new specification for the Repository pattern is being discussed in Jakarta Persistence GitHub
