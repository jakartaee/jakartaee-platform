### Jakarta EE 8.0.x service release request (volunteers?)

* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api/issues/102 
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api/issues/101 (related)
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api/issues/97 (related)
* Produce new BOM 
* TCK run? Should not be required if changes are limited to BOM generation
  * Probably requires a separate issue for creating TCKs for validating BOMs in a future release (post 9.1)
* Create PR to specifications repo for approving
* Regarding how long to handle Jakarta EE 8.x TCK challenges, we will continue to handle them.
* Will bring this up next call. Anyone interested in pushing this service release through can contact the platform team. A great way to learn the release process!
