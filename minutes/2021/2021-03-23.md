## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 9.1

* See TCK and GlassFish items below

### TCK Status

* Closer to zero TCK failures
  * Standalone JAXWS failures are pending two CQs for adding two missing schemas. [LJ] should pass now even without files being present, warning is printed and fallback bypassing invalid entry in catalog follows 
  * What is typical turnaround time on CQs? - [LJ] piggybacks are usually instant, new CQ takes < week
CQs: Scott: paste links here…
    * https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/metro-jax-ws/blob/master/jaxws-ri/tests/unit/testcases/xop/hello/server/wsi-swa.xsd
    * The other one is piggy backing off existing CQ.
  * Platform Webservices12/sec failures will likely be addressed by jakartaee-tck/pull/677

* GlassFish team, TCK team, others have been pushing hard on resolving TCK failures.  We don’t expect people working on the weekends but appreciate that they did.

* Pending work
  * Open Platform TCK issues
    * Require passing JAXB TCK for EE 9.1 on JDK 11 compatibility requests needs a volunteer (likely a 3 line User Guide doc change.)
    * Remove JDK signatures from signature testing (needed for allowing JDK11+ to be used for compatibility testing) using sigtest fork.
    * Remove CORBA.ORB from EJB30 tests (done + approved but waiting for EJB team to give +1).
    * Remove PortableRemoteObject#narrow calls or make them optional.
    * Ensure there is an optional group for EJB 2.x views separate from EntityBeans optional group 
    * Add Signature tests for javax.rmipackage
  * Estimate for remaining EJB 2.x changes is 2 weeks.
  * No other estimates given.
  * Need to run JAXB TCK again with new JAXB changes.

### GlassFish status

* No remaining known issues?
* When TCK is passed, a RC will be released
