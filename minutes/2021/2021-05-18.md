## Agenda and Minutes

### Statement of EE 10 Direction

* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/352

Jakarta EE 10 focuses on independent releases of individual specifications along with updating the associated TCKs to facilitate both validation of individual specification implementations and composition of TCKs into novel Jakarta EE profiles. The first new profile in focus is a core profile that supports smaller microservice based runtimes that may make use of ahead of time compilation. Work will also be done to enable independent releases of profiles and the platform specification along with a versioning scheme that supports a hybrid time box/feature driven approach for a cohesive brand awareness.

* Add issues in the issue tracker for Platform and Web Profile
* Submit plan reviews for these two

### Versioning/Release scheme

* For comparison purposes, here’s how “new features” mean to LTS in the Java SE environment:
