## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)

* Still need interceptors release. 
    * https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.interceptors/who
    * https://ci.eclipse.org/interceptors/job/1_interceptors-build-and-stage/configure - needs to update the JDK to 11 to build
* Bean Validation 3.0.1 service release done
* CDI, EJB, Transactions waiting on Interceptors
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/wiki/JPMS_Naming_Rules
    * This table should be added to the platform specification
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/wiki/Adding-Release-Notifications
    * May need to remind projects about this at a later point
* https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.ca/releases/2.1 approved
have 2.1.0-B1 release
* Requirements for separated TCKs proposal in discussion
   * These need to be explicitly listed in the platform specification / TCK documentation
   * How will tests that are added to refactored-out test suites be added back into the platform TCK?
   * **Action:** Have the proposal ready for the next platform call

### Project Proposal for Jakarta Commons

* https://docs.google.com/document/d/19eN3pQxtoMNoiqEKasPzbuTjUcYBC4pS0TGT12lVE3Y/edit 
* Tomas Langer gave an overview of the proposal
* Discussion
    * Produce multiple JARs to avoid a single “root” dependency for all specifications
    * Would also result in multiple JPMS modules
    * How to avoid it being a “dumping ground” for everything that doesn’t fit elsewhere?
    * Will need strict control and “high cost of entry” to avoid it becoming the tail that wags the dog
    * All specs would be required to be on the latest version
    * Pro: reuse. Con: less flexibility to change the common stuff
    * Will bring order and common architecture to the platform
    * Consistency across specifications
    * Could this be a library project? Or should it be a specification?
        * If vendors may want to implement their own version e.g. for performance reasons, then a TCK is needed and it should be a proper specification

*--- The following items were not discussed due to time constraints ---*
