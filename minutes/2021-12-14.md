## Agenda and Minutes

* Jakarta EE 10 Status (standing agenda item)
    * **Component specs need to be finalized by Q1 2022**, platform and profiles as soon as possible after that early in Q2
        * Pull Requests for Release Reviews: [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pulls](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pulls) 
        * Need to follow up with the specifications with no progress and possibly drop them from EE 10 if they can’t deliver by Q1
    * “Umbrella Committers” would be great in order to be able to do cross-project tasks and help out projects where needed
        * Scott will bring this up with the Specification Committee(Dec 15 meeting) 

* Semantic versioning revisited
    * Tools for detecting semantic versioning problems in the build
    * Discussion going on on the CDI mailing list
    * Use OSGi annotations to enforce semantic versioning?
    * OSGi metadata in prior version (baseline) is used for checking correct versioning
    * JPMS metadata can be generated from the same tooling
    * Build-time aware frameworks are not necessarily happy with provided scope annotations (which is commonly used for the OSGi semver annotations); need to use compile scope for the dependency
    * Next steps: 
        * Close the discussion on the CDI mailing list and reach some sort of agreement
        * Add to agenda for next CDI call
        * Calendar: [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=eclipse-foundation.org_e9ki8t2gc75sh07qdh95c8ofvc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FStockholm](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=eclipse-foundation.org_e9ki8t2gc75sh07qdh95c8ofvc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FStockholm)

    * Tool to help generating AsciiDoc documentation form Jakarta component spec dependencies
    * Maven Plugin: [https://github.com/ferstl/depgraph-maven-plugin](https://github.com/ferstl/depgraph-maven-plugin) (test still pending)
