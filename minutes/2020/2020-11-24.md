* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFfD0ezjr1QFM3onGK76E3RhItN5FFEfhz12VA5wGYQ/edit
* “Web Services Tests” issue. What is the problem?
  * Metro team tested using JDK 11 and it was ok.
  * We should leave this to clarify with Kevin.
* Discussed Java SE levels
  * Implementation must run on Java SE 11
* Discussed TCK splitting
  * Recommendation for how this should be done must be defined
  * This work should not block or delay 9.1
* We should set up some dates for the 9.1 release so individual component specifications know what timeframe they have to “do stuff”
  * Get estimates/proposals from: 
    * GlassFish
    * Platform TCK, CDI, Bean Validation, Mail,...
    * EJB (PortableRemoteObject#narrow + Orb#init aren’t in JDK 11)
