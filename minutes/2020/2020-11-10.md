## Agenda and Minutes

### Major vs Point release numbering for Platform

* In the past, Java EE and Jakarta EE only used Major releases (7, 8, 9, 10, …)
* Or, should we allow semantic versioning at the Platform level (9.1, 9.x, …)?
* General consensus on the call was to allow for point releases (semantic versioning)


### Timebox the releases or based on feature content?

* Some Specification Projects are already working on updated Specs (major and minor updates) beyond Jakarta EE 9
* Minor versions on a regular cadence was suggested (e.g. 6 months)
* Suggestion to set a goal to release minimum one version each year
* If twice a year, then allow for spring/fall timeframe (to avoid the June/Dec timeframes).  Follow Ubuntu’s schedule -- April/Oct?  March/Sept?

### Discussion regarding backwards incompatible changes

* Current Guidelines:  https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/CompatibilityRequirements 
* Should we allow breaking changes?
* Deprecate first and remove in next release?
* Give a couple of releases to prepare for incompatible changes?

### Jakarta EE 9.1 (recurring agenda item)

* Goal to release early in H1 2021
* If there are other spec ready during the year, another release (minor or major) will be on the table

### Jakarta EE NEXT (recurring agenda item)

* NEXT may be major or minor depending on the content

### Considerations for major versions

* CN4J Alliance and the impact on Jakarta EE (Jakarta EE, MicroProfile, OSGi, …)
* New specifications
* Major versions of existing specifications
