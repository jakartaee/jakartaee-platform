## Agenda

### Follow up on implementation-specific schema namespaces (ie. glassfish) [IG, KWS]

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=562416

Minutes:

- Proposal to create common XSDs location under eclipse.org/xml/ns/namespace (e.g https://eclipse.org/xml/ns/glassfish)
Webmaster could create a git repository to publish there automatically
- Or create XSDs under separate projects
- Or create XSDs under common ee4
- Ivar will help Glassfish set up their schema publishing resulting in a guide for others.
- As an example, EclipseLink uses a front end on their wiki (https://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/XSDs ), which is linked from their main website (https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/#documentation ).


### Reactivate "glassfish.org" [IG]

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=562417

Minutes:

- Bug filed. Ivar will follow up and report back when it is set up.

### What to do about 3rd party dependencies in javax namespace [SM]

Shade or not and IP implications?

Minutes:

- The shaded (Apache commons) jar would be packaged as jakarta, instead of javax.
- Steve to send a note to EMO asking for guidance and will report back.


### Platform TCK is dependent on JSR-88 (Deployment).  Since JSR-88 is pruned from Jakarta EE 9, what is the impact to the Platform TCK? [KWS, SM]

Minutes:

- Discussion is happening on the Platform mailing list.  (https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg01700.html)
- Bill pointed out that any public packaging of JSR-88 would require a complete API, Implementation, and pass the TCK.


### Any pointers on Woodstock?  Question for Bill and Ed.[SM]

Minutes: 

- Woodstock provides an admin console for Glassfish.  Although not necessary for running the TCK, it would be missed by anybody currently using Glassfish.
- Ed doesn’t have an immediate answer.  
- Ivar suggested a possible “community project”, but that might be a large development effort.  Maybe Reza and the Ambassadors have some ideas?
- Current direction is to park Woodstock for now to make progress on Glassfish 6 and running the TCK.  But, before Glassfish 6 ships, a solution for Woodstock will be necessary.
