## Agenda

### [KWS] Release Plan FAQ

- https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/pull/161 
- Allow for some additional reviews and then merge

### [KWS] Milestone/RC API artifacts are complete!

- https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-ee4j/projects/17#column-7346435 
- Will attempt to get an RC out this week for Platform and Web Profile APIs (kws)
- PR for API pom updates:  https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api/pull/56 

### [IG] XML Namespace under Jakarta

- Ivar is looking into a solution where schemas are available under https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee with manual update for now
   - Is the “jakartaee” subdirectory redundant?  BJ and Bill discussing.
   - Yes, it’s redundant, but we’ll stick with the redundancy.  Maybe...  Ivar will create a PR.  Ivar and Kevin will work on doing an inventory of the necessary schema updates.
   - XML namespace usage rules -- wiki, faq, something…
   - Schemas: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-schemas + individual specs (EJB, Faces, etc.). Need a complete list. Refer to the Java EE equivalents (http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jsc/xml/ns/javaee/index.html#8)

### [KWS] Discuss next steps with TCK, CI, and prepping for final releases…

- https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-ee4j/projects/17#column-7346442 
- Milestone/RC TCK artifacts (separate column in project board)
- Start organizing the wave deliverables
- Glassfish CI Kickoff?  Steve (or Gaurav) or Kenji?
- Ed Bratt has also been out, so a combination of meetings and vacations have affected this kickoff.

### [SMS] Requirements for Jakarta EE 9 API jars containing module-info.class files

- https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/162
- Automatic module name definitions for all APIs in Jakarta EE 9?
- Module-info.class files would need to be created with post-Java 8
- Scott will kick this discussion off on the Platform mailing list
- BJ mentioned there was a tool that could help generate the module-info.class files based off of source code annotations…  Using JDK 8...
