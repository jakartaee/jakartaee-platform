### [SM] GlassFish 6.0.0-RC1 passes TCK
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-9-TCK-results and now RC1 is available on downloads and on Staging https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.glassfish/downloads 

* WooHoo!  Congratulations! +100000!  
* Corresponding TCK (date stamped) is in the “history” folder.
* TCK locks down after this week (Oct 23).
* Change this week to enable Corba using EJB tests by default.
* Likely remove or leave RMI-IIOP tests disabled by default.
* Marlow to verify (by tomorrow) that RMI-IIOP tests + Corba Tests were included in this week’s TCK run.
  * Testing of the RMI-IIOP + Corba tests that were skipped have passed with https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/glassfish/weekly/glassfish-6.0.0-SNAPSHOT-2020-10-18.zip
  * We plan to update the Platform TCK to run the skipped (Corba) EJB30 tests by default and remove the RMI-IIOP tests.
* Address EJB tests that have Corba references when we address JDK11
* Glassfish could do additional RCs, if necessary.
