### What is the goal for backward compatibility of < 9 applications [Ed]

- Where do we document what happens to legacy applications?
- Do we need to document the old to new mappings?
  - XSDs?
  - SPEC API Classes?
  - Spec names?
  - Property name mappings?
- Add migration guide or single central document?
  - Probably create a folder in Platform git repo
  - BJ recommends a separate repo since it could be used as a sub-project within another repo. (Suggestion - jakartaee-renames as repo name) 
  - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=564345
- Possibly use a properties file as input to the migration guide. This could then be used directly by the Transformer or any other “stack product” tools.
- Nominate BJ for Platform project.
