## Agenda

### Basic EARs fail to deploy on current GlassFish6 using the REST admin interface (https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/23080). How is the CTS deploying test deployments? [SMS]

- Scott Stark == SMS
- That issue should be resolved.  The CORBA ORB needed to be incorporated before any EJBs could be deployed.  This has been resolved “this week” per Steve Millidge.
- Scott Marlow will post additional details about the CTS deployment steps in the chat room.
