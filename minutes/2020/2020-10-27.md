## Agenda and Minutes

### [DB] RMI-IIOP Section

* PR: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/pull/249
* Need to indicate that PortableRemoteObject.narrow() may be going away in the future
* Can not remove all occurrences of RMI-IIOP at this point.  It’s not accurate to remove all references.
* Agreed to remove use of `required` when referring to RMI-IIOP APIs.
* David will update the text accordingly in the PR

### [IG] Remaining tasks for finalizing the Platform Specification:

| Task | Deadline | Responsible |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/154 (Backwards Compatibility section) | Oct 30 | Kevin (with input from Dan and Will’s document) |
| TODOs in Platform Spec (several sections) 10 TODOs remaining. Kevin will create a PR for them | Oct 30 | David, Kevin, ??? |
| Update the PR for the RMI-IIOP section (including 4 remaining TODOs in the Application Programming Interface section) | Oct 30 | David |
| Platform TCK and Glassfish testing needs to be at 100%.  CCR for Glassfish needs to be created (along with corresponding public TCK results).  Some documentation updates may still need to be updated.  Promote Platform TCK by end of Thursday so others can use it. | Oct 30 | Scott Marlow |

### EJB 4.0 Specification

* May execute tests with an earlier matched set of TCK and GF.
* Proposal to wait until 9.1 to allow implementations that don’t include Corba to be considered EE compatible.
