## Agenda

### Milestone release in June [KWS]

- Development Complete - June 12
- Need PRs against the Specifications Repo
  - Best practice is to create Draft PRs to allow for discussion before the changes are actually merged.
  - Example: https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/150 (already merged!)
  - Please don’t wait until the last minute… The earlier, the better.  Thanks!
- PRs for API and Glassfish Poms are also welcome!
  - API pom:  https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api/blob/master/pom.xml 
  - Glassfish pom: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/blob/master/appserver/pom.xml 
- Minutes:
  - Went “around the room” asking for status from Specification Projects.  Andy indicated that they are making progress with the JAX-RS deliverable.  Steve indicated that both Connectors and Concurrency are close to being ready for the Milestone. So, some progress is being made.  Please encourage your respective teams to start on these Draft PRs asap.  Thanks!

### “Pruned” terminology [KWS]

- Mailing list:  https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg01810.html 
- Draft PR: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/pull/187 
- Please continue to contribute thoughts and ideas
- Minutes:
  - Pruned means “remove” (clarify usage).  This is how we used the term in the Release Plan.  Now we just need to ensure that the Specs follow this same pattern.
  - Clarify language and not carry it forward in the Platform spec.  That is, just because “pruned” was used in past Platform specs doesn’t mean that we have to carry that definition forward.

### Glassfish initiated PRs for OSGi metadata [SM]

- “Random” PRs from the Glassfish team against the various Compatible Impls.  Please review, approve, and merge.  These are required before we do a Milestone release for Glassfish.
