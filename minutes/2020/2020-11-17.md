## Agenda and Minutes

### Major vs Point release numbering for Platform

**DECISION**
* Major version of platform:
  * New major version of specifications
  * New specifications added	
  * Backward incompatible changes
* All others are minor

### Timebox the releases or based on feature content?

**DECISION**
* Goal to release 9.1 early in H1 2021
* If there are other spec ready during the year, another release (minor or major) will be on the table
* The time boxed option will be considered later

### Discussion regarding backwards incompatible changes

* Current Guidelines:  https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/CompatibilityRequirements 
* Should we allow breaking changes?
  * Is PortableRemoteObject moving to EJB SPEC API a breaking change?
    * No, applications can still use Java 8 PortableRemoteObject.
    * TCK tests will change to EJB SPEC API PortableRemoteObject though in 9.1.
* Deprecate first and remove in next release?
* Give a couple of releases to prepare for incompatible changes?
* Ask the projects if they have breaking changes prepared?
* Breaking changes **must** be documented thoroughly in the projectâ€™s plan review
* If a breaking change affects the platform, it must be identified in the platform specification as well

### Jakarta EE 9.1 (recurring agenda item)

* Goal to release early in H1 2021
* GlassFish 6.x JDK 11 support
* Platform TCK JDK 8 + 11 or only JDK 11 support?
* If GlassFish 6.2 only supports JDK 11, which EE implementation passes the (optional) JDK 8 tests on EE 9.1 for certification?
* Should we start requesting plan reviews from all components that want to release new versions with 9.1? 
  * Set a deadline for this?
  * Set requirements for inclusion in the release
    * Plan plan review for the platform specification
    * Create a draft of this (release plan)
    * Continue this discussion next week (start with this)

### Jakarta EE NEXT (recurring agenda item)

* NEXT may be major or minor depending on the content

### How do we handle Optional parts (discussion item for next meeting)

* Will potentially require a change in the EFSP
* Bring this to the specification committee
