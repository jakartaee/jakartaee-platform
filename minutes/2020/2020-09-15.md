## Agenda

### [SPM] Please recap result from discussion on Jan 21, 2020 `RMI-IIOP and CORBA [BS]`

---
_From Minutes 2020-01-21
Interoperability tests can be moved out of Platform TCK, into (new) separate standalone TCK
Or, they can be left in the Platform TCK with appropriate tags to avoid/allow execution.
Could be used by vendors that still implement RMI-IIOP + Corba_

---

* Minutes:
   * From the release plan: “Support for Distributed Interoperability in the EJB 3.2 Core Specification, Chapter 10 Pruned (removed)”
   * Remove RMI-IIOP testing only from the Platform is the chosen option
      * **DECISION: Make tests configurable to be run or always disabled**
   * Other option could be to remove IIOP-RMIIOP tests explicitly
      * Decided against this since there may be some usage of these tests by existing app servers
   * [Emily] We should update Platform TCK doc to list possible keyword.properties to handle things like disable RMI-IIOP testing (if a keyword approach is followed).  jakartaee-tck/issues/509

### [SM] Status of CDI TCK (downloads)

* CDI passed the ballot yesterday (official TCK version 3.0.1) 
* Still test failures for CDI in GlassFish (TCK version 3.0.0)
* There is an **unofficial** TCK version 3.0.2 available as well on the EE4J site…
   * According to the discussion today, the 3.0.2 was created, but not needed.  The official CDI TCK at this point is version 3.0.1.
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/23205 is Full Platform CDI/GF issue

### [WK] Mail Spec/TCK

* Last bit left (only publishing/merge)
* There may be a bit of description helpful for the promotion job and manual steps necessary after it ran

### [WK] Websocket

* I saw, Websocket has done nothing in https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/websocket-api/issues/357, I pointed them to the two Google Docs, but not sure, how the status is there?

### [IG] We need a release lead for Jakarta EE 10

Volunteers are encouraged to step forward
