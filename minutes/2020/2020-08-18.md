## Agenda
### IG] Specification Ballot Status

* Ready for ballot:
https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Aballot
* Follow up sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTUpfdLZZrk2_UGwoX2w0seOCueRO3sQJIjWxpDAa7g/edit#gid=0
* Minutes:
  * Encourage mentors to reach out to teams that have not started ballot yet
  * Project teams must be aware of the new/updated schemas in the implementations and TCKs as this will probably involve some work to get done.

### [WK] Status of module changes:

* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g8jYG0JixO3wzZkpeyU1LMIQRhbnZ76kGtdMFE8mieE/edit#gid=0
* Minutes:
   * Mentors of specs that are not done (in the spreadsheet above) should check this before PR is approved to be ready for ballot.

### [EB] TCK User Guides

* Feedback wanted!
* API Teams should verify that their TCK user documentation is correct

### Help debug problems with TCK and GlassFish

* Other implementations are encouraged to reach out so we can verify if the problems are with GlassFish or the TCK. 
* Particularly issues with Web Profile, JDBC and EJB
* Are other teams running the TCK encountering the same problems as GlassFish?
* Issues: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aee9-tck
