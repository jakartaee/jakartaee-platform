## Agenda

### XML Schema Discussion [BS]

- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cCGLYsCVz9pkUnMCdwaiLraepcxuemMbmUymgdMKUQY/edit#gid=0 
- Where/how to publish implementation-specific schemas? [BS]
  - Suggestion: Add implementation specific namespaces under https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/<impl-specific-ns> [IG]
  - Use a separate url for the implementation-specific schemas (ie. glassfish).  Something like https://org.eclipse/xml/ns 
  - Ivar will follow up with the EF to see if a separate url/repo can be setup for the implementation-specific schemas.
- Whoâ€™s handling Enterprise Web Services (JSR 109) schemas? [BS]
  - Need to update https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jax-ws-api/issues/98 with this request.  Request for IBM to drive since they originally owned this JSR 109 spec.
- FYI, also JAXB schemas here. [BS]
  - Lukas has already started moving on this request...
- New suggestion for Schemas at https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/: https://deploy-preview-700--jakartaee.netlify.com/schemas/  [IG]
  - Ivar will add some introductory text like the xmlns.jcp.org
  - Subpage per sub-namespace.  Or, perhaps divide up this one page with multiple namespaces.  Need to experiment with the layouts.
  - jaxb and jaxws namespaces should change to something else

### [SM] Use of non-Eclipse Copyright date formatting in TCK

- This came up on https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/pull/175, should this be raised on a ml or discussed here?  
  - We can send mail if that makes more sense.
  - Also posted to the PMC mailing list:  https://www.eclipse.org/lists/ee4j-pmc/msg02598.html 
- When updating TCK source for EE 9, should we follow existing convention?
  - GlassFish copyright tool could be used. 
- Or follow Eclipse formatting for Copyright dates.
- Keep following Eclipse formatting:  <original year> [, <current year of update>]
- All existing Oracle Copyright statements in the code should be left intact.
- Except when updating the <current year of update> for the jakarta.* namespace update.
- If new content is being provided, then an additional Copyright can be inserted citing the organization, individual, or the Eclipse Foundation as contributors.  Follow the conventions outlined in the Eclipse Handbook.
- Need to find a proper location to document this...


### Transformer Project update [BJ]

- https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-transformer 
- https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals (all proposals, if you are interested)
- Moving forward with proposal.  BJ needs to check with Wayne (EMO) on the next steps of publishing this for a vote.
- Werner asked about IDE updates for the jakarta namespace update
  -Tanja and Ivar provided an update.  Not much progress on this front.  Jakarta EE Steering Committee is helping to drive this request.
