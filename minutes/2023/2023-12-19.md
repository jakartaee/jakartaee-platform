                * Remove all rows with OPT.
                * Fix the header text so it does not mention any of this REQ, POPT, OPT business.
                * Remove the Status column, since everything is required.
            * Do I have this right?
                * No response in meeting.
                * ACTION: Make the changes in the [draft PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/807), seek review, as usual.
