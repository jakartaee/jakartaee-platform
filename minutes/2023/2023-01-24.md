## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 11
* Prepare for release planning
    * Draft a release plan on [Jakarta EE Platform Project (eclipse-ee4j.github.io)](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/) - Ivar
    * Propose a timeline with milestones
    * Publish the plan to spec projects to get feedback
* Create poll questions for specification projects
    * Do you plan to release a spec version that could be included in EE 11?
    * What Java SE version would your version require (Compatible implementation must pass TCK on SE 21)
    * Do you plan to extract/create a standalone TCK?
    * Draft the poll in a separate document: Ed will start a document
* How to we handle potential new specification to include in the platform
* Are any specifications candidates for moving between profiles?
    * BV to Core Profile?
    * Concurrency to Core Profile?
* Will anything be deprecated in EE 11?
    * Did we deprecate anything in 10 that are candidates for removal?
    * Optional features
* How to handle “stale” specifications
    * Allocate resources? How to do that?
* Standalone TCKs
    * Ensure that they can be run in app server, not only standalone

### Service Release 8.0.1
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api/issues/97](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api/issues/97) 
* [Jakarta EE Platform - ONLY_FOR_EE8-StagingRelease [Jenkins] (eclipse.org)](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-platform/job/ONLY_FOR_EE8-StagingRelease/)

### Split out tutorial repositories
* The following repositories are currently under the Platform Project
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tutorial](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tutorial) 
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tutorial-examples](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tutorial-examples)
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-firstcup](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-firstcup) 
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-firstcup-examples](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-firstcup-examples) 
* **Suggestion**: Move this out of the Platform to a more suitable location
    * Decided that this is a good idea. Ivar will proceed 

### Move platform repositories from eclipse-ee4j to jakartaee GitHub organization
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform) 
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api)

* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/managed-beans-spec](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/managed-beans-spec) 
* **Suggestion**: Do this now before we get too far with Jakarta EE 11
    * Ivar will go ahead and create a ticket to get them moved
    * Remove "-spec" from the managed-beans-spec repository name
