    * _Pick your favorite topic and create an issue (nobody else will…)_
    * Add a comment in the doc with link to the issue
* **Action**: Create a tracking issue for each component specification that is planning a release for EE 11 (based on project lead [responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VX38Ybf8fGVDmAhUTbUpxAeWENSzTHkEThv8aKVEkaY/edit#gid=1045674237)) - Ivar will start with this, but anyone can help… 

### Jakarta Persistence is planning a minor update (backward compatible) (3.2)
* Lukas will update when a plan is starting to get ready
* The industry seems very interested in this specification
* The project now has bi–weekly calls (insert link). Do join these calls to provide input!

### Jakarta Data
* Monitoring the progress
* Too early to decide now
* TCK isn’t written yet
* Will run a formal vote on the mailing list to decide whether to include or not later

### Jakarta EE 11 release coordinator
* GitHub extension for Azure DevOps: Ed investigated and found this is not a good fit.
* What about getting help from one of our member organizations in the Greater China Region?
    * Language is a big barrier. Not a good fit for peer-level, co release-coordinator role.
    * Still possible to enlist help via Shanghai MSFT team.
* Ed to interview Arjan about the release co-coordinator role in 16:00 - 16:30 CEST late afternoon 2023-04-19. 

### Clean up committers/leads action from last call
* Emily will follow up
