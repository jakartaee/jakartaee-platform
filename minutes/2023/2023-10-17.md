## Agenda and Minutes

### Seeking issue captain for [platform-552-cdi-centric](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/552) ([jea-69](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/69)).
* Scott Marlow described the job to be done as going door-to-door for all the specs reminding them of the “big ticket feature” status of “cdi-centric” for EE 11, and therefore reminding everyone to consider what changes they need to support this feature.
* Ed to ask Arjan to see if he can be the issue captain for this.
* Also need to move CDI TCK integration tests with other specs to those spec TCKs.  Similar with RESTful Web Services TCK?

### [jea-65](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/65) Persistence JDBC 4.3 Lukas and Jared: all good?
* No. We are not all good. Need to make a change in platform and web specs. See [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/618](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/618)
* What about connectors?
    * Not being updated for EE11. But connectors is already based on EE 11 and therefore does have JDBC 4.3

### EclipseCon in-progress update
* Community day for Java Developers was 2023-10-16.
    * Adoptium
    * Jakarta EE
    * MicroProfile
    * Two full tracks.  iJUG organized it.
    * There will be recordings.
    * Adam Bien talk: what he had to change in his stack in the last 8 years: not much. Therefore, the architecture can be seen as resilient to industry evolution.
* Today continued with a regular conference.
    * Workshop: 18 participants
    * Panel on Thursday: MP and Jakarta EE.

### [Cdi-687-integration-spec](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/issues/687)
* Status?
* Rename this to Jakarta CDI Integration?
* Corner case about the TCK for CDI-Integration with respect to the ordering of Waves and the dependencies they have.
    * Consider [https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan)
        * Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection Enterprise Edition (CDI EE) is in Wave 7.
            * We need a TCK for Jakarta CDI integration released in Wave 7 that has dependencies on specs that are in the Web Profile only.
            * We need a second TCK artifact for Jakarta CDI integration that addresses the dependencies on specs that are in the Platform profile, such as Jakarta Messaging (Wave 6) and Jakarta Connectors (Wave 4).
* => Emily surfaced an alternate proposal in the platform-dev list previously.
    * Emily to also link to this alternate proposal in cdi-687.
    * Include the proposal itself and a link to the discussion in the platform-dev list.
    * It is possible this proposal may be easier in some ways than the existing profile.

### [Jea-176-schemas](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/176)
* W3C Schemas via HTTPS: done.
* Lukas recalled there was some action in a previous release for XML Soap Attachments, but it was resolved.

### SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml
* A good security best practice. See [OpenSSF introduces the Specification Security Insights 1.0 - Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/blog/2023/10/11/openssf-introduces-the-specification-security-insights-1-0/) \
