## Agenda and Minutes

### Proposal: Start 30 minutes early for maintenance release type items.
* Jan, we can give that a try. EE11 release management should also be there.
* Ed and Tanja will figure it out offline.

### Requesting approval to remove unused items in Faces in 5.0:
* These three would have been removed in Faces 4.1. The recently approved deprecation process does indeed cover this kind of case. 
* Emily observed 
    * The spec committee needs to grant this exception. 
    * Will bring this up at the next spec committee meeting, with the understanding this is pre-approved.
    * It is a wasted effort to do 4.1 to accommodate these changes.
* <code>[https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1549](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1549) - composite:extension tag (tag created, but never implemented behaviour) </code>
* <code>[https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1707](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1707) - PreDestroyCustomScopeEvent and PostConstructCustomScopeEvent classes (not used due to the removal of JSF managed beans) </code>
* <code>[https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1725](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1725) - UIComponent.bindings field (should have been removed in Faces 4.0) </code>

### Milestone releases
* Communicate M1 date. <strong>December 5 proposed</strong>
* Continue discussion regarding defining a train of milestones that the component specs can opt-in to. E.g. Every month, or every second month?
* Milestone requirements discussion.
    * Jan concern about additional
        * Tests should be deactivated at a fine grained level
        * What is the goal? Push out any release, broken or not? We should have some kind of quality control.
    * Ed stated form M1: let’s not even worry about the component spec tests. It’s ok to have failing tests.
    * Tom: some of it may depend on can the tests even compile?
        * Does it even need to be in maven central?
        * <strong>Use the staging environment for hosting the milestones.</strong>
    * Emily: Milestone release should be determined by the component teams themselves. Some specs have all things together, other specs have separate repos for TCK.
    * Jared: It’s hard to have impls when you don’t have api artifacts. \
