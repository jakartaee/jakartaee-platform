* Release Plan [DRAFT](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan)

### Application Client Container (from last call)
* Is this still relevant?
* Mark as deprecated in Jakarta EE 11 and then remove it in Jakarta EE 12?
    * Deprecate in Jakarta EE 11 and document the better technology such as using Rest Client etc.
    * Open an issue on jakarta platform to document this and track user feedback
* Running EJB code on the client side. As EJB is not that important any more because of CDI, we should consider marking it as deprecated.
* Application client is used to access remote service, does CDI offer the same?
    * No but CDI does not do the remote call.

### Duplicate class files in platform JARs ([Regression: EE 10 Platform API JARs include all classes, and transitive dependencies to Spec API JARs leading to duplicate classes and JPMS split package failures and OSGi issues](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-api/issues/133))
* Scott will take a look at this issue

### Faces challenges: [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1722](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1722)
* Ed will investigate this.

### Issue for commenting on Jan's slides
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/607](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/607)

### Any data of adopting Jakarta EE 10
* Check with vendors
* Use Jakarta EE survey to find out
* Support of the Java SE level availability
* Support from one system with all kinds of dependencies brings complication
* Promote the latest releases
    * Green field project might be a good fit to use Jakarta EE 10
    * Jakarta EE starters and advocacies 
    * Conference talks on migrating from Jakarta EE 8 to EE 10
    *  Security is one of the drivers to move up but Jakarta EE might not fit in this category.
