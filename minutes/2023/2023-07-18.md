### Wave discussion JEA-6

### CDI/CDI-lite to separate JEA-9

### Core profile
* What do want with it?
    * Anything we include comes up in MP
    * Does Core profile have standalone usage?
        * Helidon implements the MicroProfile
        * There does not seem to be any product ONLY implementing the Core Profile
        * Certification usage
* Validation to core?

### Specs that are NOT updated (eg Jakarta Inject)
* Have CVEs in their dependencies
    * Who will update them???
    * Service release -> does not need plan
    * Updated artefact -> only update pom essentially (spec number stays the same)
    * Impact in build plug-ins (building spec document, running TCK)
        * Impacts CIs and Jakarta devs, not so much end-users
    * Work with Eclipse Foundation
        * Supply chain group
