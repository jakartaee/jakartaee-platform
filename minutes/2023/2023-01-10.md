##  Agenda and Minutes

### TCK challenges
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1753](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1753) 
    * Accepted. Needs a TCK update. Emily will investigate if IBM can propose a PR, and/or ping the face team on the faces mailing list
* [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1757](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1757)
    * Not accepted yet. Emily will ping faces on the mailing list.
* Revisit the above challenges next week  

### Look at everything that’s optional in EE 10 and remove from the platform for EE 11?
* EJB 2 API group
    * Move APIs to a separate folder/module within the API project?
    * Vendors can still include it (like they can include Jakarta MVC) 
* We should create a complete list of all optional features, and whole specifications
* Define how to handle implementations that want to include optional features 

### Topics for next Jakarta EE Platform Architecture Call (February 7)
* Anything we need from/communicate to the spec projects?
    * How to handle Loom. Ed will see if someone from the Java Team could do a short presentation
    * Make sure we have reps from concurrency there as well
* Suggestion to have the Jakarta Security and MP JWT Discussion revisited in the call
    * Jan can prepare some slides as a base for the discussion
    * Add this topic to next week’s platform call as well 

### Jakarta EE 11
* Java SE Version
* Will we be able to release EE 11 6 months after SE 21 with SE 21 as the baseline?
* Is a jump from SE 11 to SE 21 a bit too aggressive?
* SE 17 is EOL in 2026
* Remove Security Manager requirement for EE 11?
* (EJB item from above)
* Poll spec projects for which SE features they want to incorporate ([Run a Java SE feature poll for EE 11 · Issue #561 · eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform (github.com)](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/561))
    * E.g. Records, 
    * Loom ([JEP 436: Virtual Threads (Second Preview) (openjdk.org)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/436))
        * Managed virtual thread executors
        * Uses of ThreadLocal
        * Provide top level support for Loom
    * Use of Finalizers (deprecated in 18, [JEP 421: Deprecate Finalization for Removal (openjdk.org)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/421), [https://inside.java/2022/05/25/clean-cleaner/](https://inside.java/2022/05/25/clean-cleaner/) )
* Revisit the Jakarta EE 11 document ([Jakarta EE Next Discussion - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-dkvbL0iFFzitO4vt1SVq6GGSJyFdCDM2NU_FzGS10/edit#heading=h.1oyn459kodrn))
* Most of the items above can be done in EE 11 even if SE 21 is not the selected base
* Start creating issues in GitHub issue tracker labeled as “Candidate for Jakarta EE 11”
