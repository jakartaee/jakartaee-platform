## Agenda and Minutes

### ACTION: Get Jakarta EE 11 Release Plan [DRAFT](https://jakartaee.github.io/jakartaee-platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan) ([source link](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/blob/gh-pages/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan.md)) beyond **DRAFT** state
* [EE11 labeled issues](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEE11)
* Wave discussion: see [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/issues/685](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/issues/685)
* Nathan brought up the question of what about the proposed new specs?
    * Resolved to get a sufficiently done version in 685 and then apply the proposed new specs. This is not an official endorsement of the inclusion of that new spec in EE11, but it’s useful to think about it now.
    * ACTION: Arjan to take the discussion we did to day to the platform-dev list. Subject: platform-685: Wave discussion
* 
* Lenny’s Issue [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/issues/138](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/issues/138) two PRs
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/pull/139](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/pull/139)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/pull/137](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/pull/137)
    * But what about the subtlety of CDI vs CDI lite?
        * Web profile includes all of CDI
        * Core profile only includes CDI lite
        * Lenny’s answer: you just add it on as a regular maven dependency.
    * ACTION: Arjan to take the discussion to platform-dev. Subject: jakartaee-api: 138: Lenny’s PRs.
