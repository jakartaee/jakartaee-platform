## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 11 Release Planning
* Release Plan [DRAFT](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan)
* Discussion whether the drafted timeline is realistic
* The resolution from the Steering Committee indicates to favor a timeboxed release
* We need to ask the spec teams what they would be able to deliver in this timeframe. Then decide if the featureset justifies a release.
* Milestones for component specs will be essential
* Platform milestone release must be added to the timeline (Q4 2023?)
* Investigate how to handle releases of milestones
    1. Publish milestones to Maven Central
* TCK results from runs on vendor infra take too long to get back to projects
    2. If made more easy available for spec projects would potentially speed up the process 

### Jakarta EE 11 Survey for spec projects
* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lMzewNjNKaqeUPnnnODW45HUXtg2GQ8y8t11MFmL9Q8/edit?pli=1#heading=h.236lptjuxodl](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lMzewNjNKaqeUPnnnODW45HUXtg2GQ8y8t11MFmL9Q8/edit?pli=1#heading=h.236lptjuxodl) 
* Questions to add:
    3. Dependencies on planned features in specs a spec depends on
* Next steps
    4. Finalize the survey questions - By end of this week (**Feb 3**)
        * Action for all: Review and update the questions
    5. Send out the survey to spec teams - Before Monthly Platform Architecture Call next week (**Feb 7**) - Ivar
    6. Deadline for survey: one week (**Feb 14**)
