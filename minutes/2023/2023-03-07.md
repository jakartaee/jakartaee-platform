## Agenda and Minutes

### Follow up discussion
* Virtual Threads in Jakarta EE 11 ([https://openjdk.org/jeps/436](https://openjdk.org/jeps/436) )
    * [Issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issues/268) opened on Jakarta Concurrency 
        * [Asynchronous annotation](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/blob/master/api/src/main/java/jakarta/enterprise/concurrent/Asynchronous.java)
        * How much impact on other specs?
    * What about servlet or other async features of Jakarta REST?
        * AsynchronousServlet in Servlet
        * Suspend/Resume request and [ClientBuilder.executorService](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.ws.rs/jakarta/ws/rs/client/clientbuilder#executorService(java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService)) in Jakarta REST (async scenario in Jakarta REST [blog](https://dzone.com/articles/asynchronous-rest-with-jax-rs-and-microprofile))
        * Asynchronous in EJB
        * XML Web Services (SOAP)
    * Decision to be made regarding which spec needs to support virtual thread.
    * Could this be implemented by app runtime?
    * Virtual thread needs to be in the spec?
        * Compute intensive tasks need to be platform thread?
            * Discussed but not agreed with an answer 
        * Would default be platform thread or virtual thread?
        * Should an end user care about whether a virtual thread or platform thread is used?
    * Thread pool to control load and resources

        ```
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor(); // New method
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(Integer poolSize); // Old method
        ```

* Other Java SE 21 features to leverage in Jakarta EE 11
    * JPMS support
    * Record support in JPA
        * No use case for entity
        * Entity: how to track lifecycle
    * Record support for Jakarta Data
        * Good for DTOs,
    * Record support for JSON-B and JSON-P
    * Record support for RESTful Web Services
    * Record support for CDI beans: should work
