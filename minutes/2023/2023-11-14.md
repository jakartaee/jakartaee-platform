## Agenda and Minutes

### Housekeeping
* Arjan to run the meeting Nov 7, **14**, 21, and 28

### [Jea-69](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/69) cdi centric [platform-552](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/552).

Currently, you need to do this:

```
@Produces @PersistenceContext(unitName="UserData")
@Users EntityManager userDatabaseEntityManager;

@Inject @Users EntityManager userDatabase;
```

 —-> Move essentially that code to a CDI extension so users don't have to add it

### Jakarta Persistence injection of EntityManager 
* See [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jpa-dev/msg00191.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jpa-dev/msg00191.html)
    * Platform pr is [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746)
* See [https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/pull/460](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/pull/460)
* Any updates?
    * May want to get to some sort of decision soon
    * **Prototype for CDI injection?**
* NO HARD dependency on CDI in persistence (needs to be used outside EE, like Spring, Tomcat, etc)
* EE chapter in persistence spec (in an EE environment and only in an EE environment, it should be X and Y)
* Multiple persistence providers
    * Hibernate for app 1
    * EclipseLink for app 2
    * TopLink for app 3
* Emily argued we may want to put the requirements for this in the platform spec
* Transactions has a hard dependency now on CDI
    * Give it an EE chapter
* Servlets becoming CDI beans
    * [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/servlet-dev/msg00611.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/servlet-dev/msg00611.html)
    * [https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/jakarta-platform-spec-10.0#annotations-and-injection](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/jakarta-platform-spec-10.0#annotations-and-injection)
        * Via the platform spec, Servlets get a “fake/simulated” CDI treatment, providing:
            * @PostConstruct / @PreDestroy
            * @Inject
            * Interceptors (theoretically, practice more difficult)
        * Real CDI would additionally provide:
            * Scopes
            * Decorators
            * Ability to be vetoed
            * Programmatically enhance them in extensions with all those things
            * Automatically gets new CDI features; no need to update all the various CDI simulation code

### Simulate disappeared SecurityManager?
* Code level security was intended for a trusted AS to run untrusted apps
* Today we run AS + single App in (docker) container or Virtual PC (Xen, vmware) \
