### Jakarta Data

* Where to put it? 
    * Web Profiile?
    * Could be a candidat for Core Profile, but that would need to be coordinated with other projects like MicroProfile
* Discussed if we should have a vote on the mailing list to add it.
* Inclusion of Jakarta Data in Jakarta EE 11 [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/issues/640](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/issues/640) 

### Jakarta NoSQL
* Is this spec ready for EE 11?
* Invite Otavio to a Platform call in the near future
* Eclipse JNoSQL is currently the only implementation, seems to be good progress 
* Jakarta Data could trigger more implementations of Jakarta NoSQL 

### Jakarta MVC
* One implementation (Eclipse Krazo) that comes in two flavors: RESTEasy and Jersey
    * TCK passes on GlassFish, WildFly and Open Liberty
* Spec is mature currently 2.1, ready for EE 11?
* Good lightweight complement to Jakarta Faces
* Builds on Jakarta REST
* A 3.0 is planned in the EE 11 timeframe 

### Plan Review deadline for component specifications
* Start communicating the date to the projects
