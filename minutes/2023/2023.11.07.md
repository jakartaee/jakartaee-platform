## Agenda and Minutes

### jakartaee-api default branch renamed from master to main
* An example of the new self-service: [https://github.com/jakartaee/.eclipsefdn/pull/1](https://github.com/jakartaee/.eclipsefdn/pull/1) 
* Is there a technical benefit?
    * Whatever the original reasons, it’s the new default now for GitHub
    * MicroProfile
        * Everything renamed by Emilly
        * No problems observed

### Housekeeping
* Arjan to run the meeting Nov 7, 14, 21, and 28

### [Jea-69](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/69) cdi centric [platform-552](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/552).
* Status?
* Jakarta Persistence injection of EntityManager 
    * See [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jpa-dev/msg00191.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jpa-dev/msg00191.html)
    * See [https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/pull/460](https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/pull/460)
    * Where to put the tests if the spec is simply *supporting* CDI (as opposed to being based on CDI)?
        * In the CDI EE integration spec?
        * Alternative (and preferred future?): The integration tests could be placed in an optional TCK module for component specs not already depend on CDI
        * Jakarta Persistence merely supports CDI (does not depend on it)
            * EntityListeners are injectable by CDI 
            * Spring uses Jakarta Persistence, and persistence being dependent on CDI would be hard for them and/or break things. Same for Tomcat/Jetty.
        * Do (some) Jakarta EE spec teams want to be SE only (and have EE somewhere else)?
            * Some came from the JDK. They are not all EE focussed.
            * Have tests that are only needed for EE certifications separate.
* Servlets becoming CDI beans
    * [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/servlet-dev/msg00611.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/servlet-dev/msg00611.html)
    * Should Servlets be injected in other places? (probably no)
    * Do Servlets support interceptors?
    * Give them the ability to have a scope, intercept them, decorate them, veto etc
    * [https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/jakarta-platform-spec-10.0#annotations-and-injection](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/jakarta-platform-spec-10.0#annotations-and-injection)
    * 

### Some projects have few or no committers or leads missing

### Status of CDI restructuring
* CDI Restructuring PR: [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/665](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/665) 
    * Ivar will contact Scott -> if done, kick of ballot 
* CDI EE Creation PR: [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/666](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/666) 

### [Jea-10](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/10) ee-11-m1
* Created GitHub milestone to track those that have already been published to maven central
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/milestone/2](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/milestone/2) 
* Others that have a maven artifact [jea-234](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/234).
    * cdi, cdi-el, lang-model have Alpha1 for API and up to Alpha5 for TCK
    * interceptor has RC1
    * persistence has B01
        * —> (Re)publish M1
* Other that DO NOT have a maven artifact yet
    * Security specs
    * Faces

### [Jea-215](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/215) API to expose platform versions [platform-762](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/762)
* I’d like to get clarity on whether or not we attempt this in EE 11. My gut instinct right now is: ~~no~~. maybe.
* The group discussed several aspects.
    * The “override” case (if the vendor does not like the defaults)
        * Platform defines the **WebProfile** interface, as in this [proposal](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/762#issuecomment-1741802201).
        * This interface has a “lineup” of all the versions of all the specs in that platform.
        * What about if an impl of a component spec wants to override?
        * Do we need to consider this corner case?
        * If so, isn’t this a kind of “config”, and if so, shouldn’t we be looking at this as Jakarta Config?
        * What about the good old fashioned “Service Loader” technique?
            * CDI and JSON specs currently use this.
    * Dmitry gave an update on Config: Not available for use in EE11.
* Ed polled the group on the utility of the idea in general.
    * Arjan and Nathan shared concrete examples for doing this.
* We would need to add TCK
    * Platform TCK
    * Web Profile TCK
    * Core Profile TCK

### Spec lead election for Jakarta Validation should happen asap.
* Election started

### Social sharing:
* Was really nice to see recent LinkedIn conversation about helping with EE 11 TCKs refactoring [https://twitter.com/scottmarlow/status/1721540513671577730](https://twitter.com/scottmarlow/status/1721540513671577730)
