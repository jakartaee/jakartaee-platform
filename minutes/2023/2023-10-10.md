### [Cdi-687-integration-spec](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/issues/687)
* Status?
* Rename this to Jakarta CDI Integration?
* Corner case about the TCK for CDI-Integration with respect to the ordering of Waves and the dependencies they have.
    * Consider [https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan)
        * Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection Enterprise Edition (CDI EE) is in Wave 7.
            * We need a TCK for Jakarta CDI integration released in Wave 7 that has dependencies on specs that are in the Web Profile only.
            * We need a second TCK artifact for Jakarta CDI integration that addresses the dependencies on specs that are in the Platform profile, such as Jakarta Messaging (Wave 6) and Jakarta Connectors (Wave 4).
* => Emily surfaced an alternate proposal in the platform-dev list previously.
    * Emily to also link to this alternate proposal in cdi-687.
    * Include the proposal itself and a link to the discussion in the platform-dev list.
    * It is possible this proposal may be easier in some ways than the existing profile.

### [Jea-10](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/10) EE 1 Milestone 1
* Ed had info sessions with Scott and Arjan

    * standardizing ci.eclipse.org job names and functionality.
        * documentation or notes that have been taken
            * GitLab issue?
        * mailing list posts or individual email
        * individuals who can make change
        * Recap of existing work from Emily
            * The reason for the work:
                * All the jobs have no structure and naming convention
                * It’s basically work-in-progress. Now is a good time to resume it.
            * [Emily]Here is the status for the CI Job discussion happened in the past

_Naming conventions and instructions: did not finalise, so no documentation was produced_
_Which jobs to run before publishing the TCK releases? To be discussed with individual spec teams. Some teams have wiki to explain CI jobs such as CDI but not all of them._
_CI job names ([https://ci.eclipse.org/](https://ci.eclipse.org/))_
_E.g. Prefix with Jakarta or suffix with  
Group jobs by owning working group in the UI (?)_
_Issue for naming ([CI job](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2397) created by Emily): the issue was closed. Maybe we should reopen it to update the individual names to have the prefix of jakarta._
_For Security project naming issue from “es” to something else:_
   _[https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2792](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2792)_
    _Proposal jakarta-[spec name]_ 

### Status of request for Ed and Arjan to have the ability to administer ci.eclipse.org jobs.
* Not yet, Ivar traveling.
* Mark Thomas did some work on this at the weekend.
