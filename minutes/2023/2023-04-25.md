## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 11 Release Plan [DRAFT](https://jakartaee.github.io/jakartaee-platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan) ([source link](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/blob/gh-pages/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan.md))

* [E11 labeled issues](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEE11)

* [Jakarta EE 11 Discussion - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-dkvbL0iFFzitO4vt1SVq6GGSJyFdCDM2NU_FzGS10/edit#heading=h.1oyn459kodrn)

* [Jakarta EE 11 - Project Lead Survey (Responses) - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VX38Ybf8fGVDmAhUTbUpxAeWENSzTHkEThv8aKVEkaY/edit#gid=1045674237)
    * How each spec lead responded to the question of what work they intend to do during EE 11.
        * This spreadsheet was created from responses to the survey
        * Security is the umbrella spec
            * Authentication and authorization have been refactored/rebased/folded/merged into into Security
            * [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2965](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2965) 
            * [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/emo/-/issues/392](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/emo/-/issues/392) 
    * Based on these responses, the platform team will approve or reject these proposals for inclusion into EE11.
    * Are we missing any responses?
        * Messaging
            * Slack channel
        * Enterprise Beans
        * Expression Language
        * Connectors
        * Batch
        * Annotations
        * Dependency Injection
        * Bean Validation
        * Standard Tag Library
    * Jan suggested if we still canâ€™t get a response, after actively seeking, then we consider **not** including it in the EE 11 platform. And if somebody wants to still have it as part of the platform, then can take over the maintenance of the component spec. 

### Jakarta EE 11 Release lead and co-lead:
* Ed Burns and Arjan Tijms
* Ensure Ed and Arjan have sufficient role empowerment in [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform)

### Better involvement from Greater China Region (GCR) members
* Ed to take this up with Emily

### Was the JQA dependency analysis helpful?
* [Scott Strak] Yes, but post mortem analysis is not sufficient. 
* [Jan] Can spend some time to automate the analysis and then it can be used for QA on the CI/CD process (and may break on quality gates).

### Delivery timeline
* Timeboxed at the expense of feature set?
* Delay delivery to get feature set?
* Scott asserted that because it is expensive to do a platform certification
    * there is no value in doing an EE 11 unless there are new features.
    * The cost of doing the certification due to all of the complexity in running the antiquated and complex ways of running TCKs.

### Ability to have Arjan be a committer requires an election.
