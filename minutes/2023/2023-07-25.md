## Agenda and Minutes

### Jakarta EE 11 Plan
* Proposed “no later than (with exceptions allowed)” date for component specs to engage in Release Review: **2023-11-15**. See JEA-5.
* Concurrency Spec plan pr [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/617](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/617)
    * Nathan correctly points out that the approved plan for Concurrency has a release date of 2024-03-28. It depends on Java 21, which is scheduled to go final in late September 2023.
* Discussion about realism of “six months after SE 21”.  Discussion is emerging that a more realistic expectation is between “six to twelve months after SE 21” and aim for nine.
    * After discussion the “no later than (with exceptions allowed)” date for component specs to engage in Release Review is currently targeted for **2024-01-30**. [JEA-126](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/126). This is 6 months, 5 days excluding the end date from today.
* Activation and Mail: Lukas Jungmann
    * What, if anything, needs to be done for these specs for use in EE 11?
        * Emily believes nothing additional needs to be done regarding Java versions in EE 11 for these specs.
    * They currently use 8
    * They will still be able to run on 21.  But if they need to re-compile, they will have to recompile to 11..
* Jan will create an issue to track use of Java SE 8 bytecode (which is not supported for compilation by SE 21 beyond SE 21. Running SE 8 bytecode on SE 21 and beyond will still work.)
* Any concerns about dates and minimums, if you want to remain anonymous, please remember you can use [https://purl.oclc.org/NET/edburns/contact](https://purl.oclc.org/NET/edburns/contact) . \

### Pruning Managed Beans (JEA-42)
* Jakarta Annotations 3.0 - Plan review ongoing
* Jan would like to do a patch release of ______________ to get rid of CVEs ______________. This should be done after  the merging of [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/pull/139](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/pull/139).
* Jan owns [JEA-128](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/128).. 

### EE 11 TCKs
* Individual specification TCKS need to be complete and ready for their respective Spec ballot release.
* As per [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/pull/1679](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/pull/1679) discussion + [https://github.com/jakartaee/specification-committee/issues/59](https://github.com/jakartaee/specification-committee/issues/59), Jakarta EE Platform implementations will not be required to pass Java SE style TCKs, instead Platform implementation will need to pass TCK tests that can be deployed to a Jakarta EE container.
    * Platform TCK tests may be added to run/extend Java SE TCK style tests.
        * Platform TCK tests that extend such tests may need to fixed in future EE releases to sync with future changes to Java SE TCK tests.
