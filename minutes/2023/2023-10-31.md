### [Jea-43](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/43) Pruning managed beans

### [Jea-215](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/215) API to expose platform versions [platform-762](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/762)
* I’d like to get clarity on whether or not we attempt this in EE 11. My gut instinct right now is: ~~no~~. maybe.
* The group discussed several aspects.
    * The “override” case (if the vendor does not like the defaults)
        * Platform defines the **WebProfile** interface, as in this [proposal](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/762#issuecomment-1741802201).
        * This interface has a “lineup” of all the versions of all the specs in that platform.
        * What about if an impl of a component spec wants to override?
        * Do we need to consider this corner case?
        * If so, isn’t this a kind of “config”, and if so, shouldn’t we be looking at this as Jakarta Config?
        * What about the good old fashioned “Service Loader” technique?
            * CDI and JSON specs currently use this.
    * Dmitry gave an update on Config: Not available for use in EE11.
* Ed polled the group on the utility of the idea in general.
    * Arjan and Nathan shared concrete examples for doing this.
* We would need to add TCK
    * Platform TCK
    * Web Profile TCK
    * Core Profile TCK

### Spec lead election for Jakarta Validation should happen asap.
* Scott Stark had already agreed to do this.
    * Ed to check with Scott and confirm that he still accepts this heavy mantle.
* One of the existing committers just has to propose Scott Stark.
