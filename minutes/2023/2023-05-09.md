## Agenda and Minutes

### Oops! jakartaee/jakartaee-platform
* https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/issues/679
* Ed requested branch **master** rename to **main** before proper notification
* Werner Keil brought up the need to care for CI/CD impact
* Conclusion: We agreed to keep it as **main** and fix the problems with high urgency.
* Ed and Arjan will meet in a separate forum to assess the job to be done to fix it.
    1. Werner: The GH pages are affected: https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/ fix the README

### ACTION: Getting all specs through Plan Review
* No replies as of yet.
* Ed and Arjan intend to start contacting project leads individually
    2. emails to the respondents that said **yes** in column “intend to make an API release for Jakarta EE 11?” in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VX38Ybf8fGVDmAhUTbUpxAeWENSzTHkEThv8aKVEkaY/edit#gid=1045674237).
    3. Other means of contacting them
    4. Partition list:
        * Arjan to define partition, Ed takes the ones Arjan does not choose.
        * Please add yourself here to opt out and state that you already have your plan review workflow in progress
            * Scott Stark, CDI has committed to May 30th date
            * Persistence - ongoing planning towards submission of the plan by the end of May ‘23

### ACTION: Get Jakarta EE 11 Release Plan [DRAFT](https://jakartaee.github.io/jakartaee-platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan) ([source link](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-platform/blob/gh-pages/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan.md)) beyond **DRAFT** state

* https://eclipse.zoom.us/j/85366098724
* A compromise solution was mooted: “bridge” spec. Historical precedent JSF-Portlet Bridge Spec [jsr-378](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=378#:~:text=The%20Java%20Portlet%203.0%20Bridge%20for%20JavaServer%20Faces,JSF%20applications%20to%20be%20accessed%20as%20Java%20portlets.).

    7. Proposed spec consolidation
    8. Mailing list subscription management
