## Agenda and Minutes

### [Cdi-687-integration-spec](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/issues/687)
* Status?
    * Restructuring review to be kicked off.
    * Do release plan for CDI EE at the same time.
    * No known blockers.
* Rename this to Jakarta CDI Integration?
    * Declined. See this [comment on 687](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/issues/687#issuecomment-1667009015).
* Corner case about the TCK for CDI-Integration with respect to the ordering of Waves and the dependencies they have.
    * Consider [https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan)
        * Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection Enterprise Edition (CDI EE) is in Wave 7.
            * We need a TCK for Jakarta CDI integration released in Wave 7 that has dependencies on specs that are in the Web Profile only.
            * We need a second TCK artifact for Jakarta CDI integration that addresses the dependencies on specs that are in the Platform profile, such as Jakarta Messaging (Wave 6) and Jakarta Connectors (Wave 4).
    * Scott Stark: The issue of where the different TCKs live with respect to the wave list is another problem, that neither CDI nor the Platform TCK has the bandwidth to address this in EE 11. So, we will have to live with this current arrangement for EE 11.
* => Emily surfaced an alternate proposal in the platform-dev list previously.
    * Also see this comment in [cdi-687](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/issues/687#issuecomment-1756339489).
    * At today’s meeting Scott Stark restated that the existing resource allocation for EE 11 does not allow for entertaining this proposal.

### [Jea-102-optional](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/102) features
* Email from Angelo Rubini regarding EJB

### [Jea-10](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/10) EE 1 Milestone 1
* Start with annotations
    * Lukas mentioned annotations should have their M1 out within a week from today, including the merging of the [“remove managed beans” PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/common-annotations-api/pull/115).
* Jakarta Data is already in maven central

### [Jea-69](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/69) [platform-552-cdi-centric](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/552) 
* For servlet in EE 11
    * Add to specification text that states that Servlets must be CDI Beans when running in an EE container.
        * What about **doGet** with annotations?
        * Proposal: in an EE environment, the base class does the self injection, before calling **doGet**.
        * What about injectability of **HttpServletRequest**? This is specified in the CDI spec. It is more appropriately specified in Servlet spec.
            * What about filters and how they wrap things?
    * If Servlet doesn’t want to have this text in the Servlet spec, we can put it in the CDI EE spec.
* Rebase EJB lite to be a CDI extension
* Scott Marlow described the job to be done as going door-to-door for all the specs reminding them of the “big ticket feature” status of “cdi-centric” for EE 11, and therefore reminding everyone to consider what changes they need to support this feature.
* Also need to move CDI TCK integration tests with other specs to those spec TCKs.  Similar with RESTful Web Services TCK? \

### SBOM generation
