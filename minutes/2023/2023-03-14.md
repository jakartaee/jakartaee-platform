    *  [Jakarta EE 11 Discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-dkvbL0iFFzitO4vt1SVq6GGSJyFdCDM2NU_FzGS10/edit#)
        * Share with the wider community for input
        * A month for a feedback from the community should be fine
* Discussion about security and problems related to Core Profile / layering: 
    * 2 HTTP stacks in EE: Servlet and REST.
        * Security largely uses Servlet (HTTPServletRequest etc)
        * Core Profile and Micro Profile use REST
            * Security can not layer upon either profile now
    * Apache Shiro security project as example
        * Constraint definitions (which URLs are protected) now mostly use Servlet’s web.xml. XML is not universally loved, and alternatives, directly using Jakarta Security would be nice.
* Plan to move to HTTP3 in Jakarta EE 11?
    * Not sure at this point (to be discussed on the servlet mailing list)
    * [https://www.section.io/engineering-education/http3-vs-http2/](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/http3-vs-http2/)
