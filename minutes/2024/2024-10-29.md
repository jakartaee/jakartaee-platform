## Agenda and Minutes

### Top-of-mind from Ed, Arjan and Jared

* Three weeks to go until we must start ballots.  
* Core Profile status  
  * [Liberty CCR](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/975) created  
  * Red Hat to make a CCR today  
  * [Release Review PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/782)   
  * API Jenkins job run.  Has the API been staged? Yes. Here is the link:  
    [https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/staging/jakarta/platform/jakarta.jakartaee-core-api/11.0.0/](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/staging/jakarta/platform/jakarta.jakartaee-core-api/11.0.0/)   
  * ACTION: Ed: Review the checklists that Ed Bratt sent, as well as the one in [the PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/782).  
  * Ed Bratt: Who is the mentor for Core Profile?  
    * Ivar: Confirmed Emily Jiang and Tom Watson  
* Arjan  
  * Tried to run the EE 11 TCK GlassFish runners at [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/tree/main/glassfish-runner](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/tree/main/glassfish-runner)  
    * There were some breakages in the CI jobs running these: [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-11/job/11/job/standalone-tck/job/eftl-jakartaeetck-run-standalone/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-11/job/11/job/standalone-tck/job/eftl-jakartaeetck-run-standalone/)  
    * Arjan advises extra care to not introduce breakages.  
  * Ed Bratt observed that the Core TCK sha sum must not change from this point onward, because we have existing CCRs. (See TCK Agenda 2024-10-30)

### Refactoring Progress Report

* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1)  
* EE 10 JPA/Persistence (Application Client) TCK tests pass with GlassFish 8 JDK 17 branch (Platform) on Java 17\.  
* Scott Marlow is still blocked in making progress for JPA tests, see [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1371](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1371) \+ [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190) .   
  * This is on the critical path if and only if we choose to use the JPA tests from the refactored TCK.  
* ACTION: Arjan: Please update “Refactor ejb32 (EE mode) tests” row in the table (currently row 51).
