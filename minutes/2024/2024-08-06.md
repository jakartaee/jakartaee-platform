## Agenda and Minutes

### Top-of-mind from Ed and Arjan

* Thanks for continuing to tune in, even though the last few meetings have been a bit light.
* Service releases
    * I believe we are all good here. Is that correct?
        * EL Service release job still has not been run.
    * If so, I will create the RC1 for EE 11.
    * **Tags API still needs to be published. It will be 3.0.1.**
* Mitigation actions for lost secrets for GPG key pair
    * This means the new public key will need to be propagated to all the places.
        * ACTION: Ivar to ensure this is adequately mitigated.

### Refactoring Progress Report

* JMS/EL TCK test changes to work with Java Test Harness.
* JPA/Persistence test changes to work with Java Test Harness is starting to be worked on (not yet clear how that will go).
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1433](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1433) 
* [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck-tools/tree/master/tools/tck-rewrite](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck-tools/tree/master/tools/tck-rewrite) + [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck-tools/tree/master/tools/tck-rewrite-ant](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck-tools/tree/master/tools/tck-rewrite-ant) + than[https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck-tools/tree/master/tools/tck-rewrite-fx](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck-tools/tree/master/tools/tck-rewrite-fx) changes merged with OpenRewrite recipe updated.
    * Tck-rewrite-fx is a Quarkus gui FX app that can be used to generate new EE test client classes for an existing TCK test client class.
    * Tck-rewrite has an OpenRewrite recipe that can be used against the [https://github.com/scottmarlow/jakartaee-tck/tree/new_rewritejpa2](https://github.com/scottmarlow/jakartaee-tck/tree/new_rewritejpa2) branch to convert ejb30/ejb32/jpa tests (others as well as long as they have their pom.xml updated).
* Imminent blocker: Need Glassfish TCK runner. See [platform-tck-1434](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1434).
* We will soon be in a position to empirically derive a date for a date. 

### Jakarta EE 11

* [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746) is merged for CDI-Persistence integration.
    * ACTION: Ed to work with Lukas Jungmann offline to include text after the merging of 746 to make the way clear. Also include Jared Andersen in this offline discussion. 
* [Deprecation of Resource/JNDI](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/355)?
    * This must be clarified in EE 12. This would require annotations 3.1. Because the release plan for 11 did not include anything about JNDI deprecation. This must be deferred to 12.

### Jakarta EE 12

* ACTION: Ed to send email about Application client deprecation.
* Start discussion on JNDI functionality replacement with CDI.
    * Datasources: resource reference is still very widely used, including the ability to authenticate.
