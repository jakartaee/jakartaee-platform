### Refactoring Progress Report

* [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-11/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-11/)
* A PR for the Persistence TCK created (the refactored version)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1442/files](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1442/files)
    * An approval from the project team is requested
    * [https://github.com/scottmarlow/jakartaee-tck/blob/70e1c8cde69cf1b3d971397bb187c8302d34bdec/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jpa/common/PMClientBase.java#L53](https://github.com/scottmarlow/jakartaee-tck/blob/70e1c8cde69cf1b3d971397bb187c8302d34bdec/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jpa/common/PMClientBase.java#L53)
        * abstract public class PMClientBase extends ServiceEETest
        * Also [https://github.com/scottmarlow/jakartaee-tck/blob/master/src/com/sun/ts/lib/harness/ServiceEETest.java#L41](https://github.com/scottmarlow/jakartaee-tck/blob/master/src/com/sun/ts/lib/harness/ServiceEETest.java#L41)
        * 
    * What about: [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1319](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1319) ?
        * Current plan is to use the test vehicles to target a sooner completion date.
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1319](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1319) approach would be a more open ended schedule that we should look at a later EE release (12?).
        * We would need a Platform vote to change the TCK plan at this time.
* Encourage everyone to join the TCK call tomorrow

### Jakarta EE 11

* Tags API 3.0.1 was published
* New release of gf: [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/releases/tag/8.0.0-M7](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/releases/tag/8.0.0-M7)

    * Ivar will update the spec page with the link to 6.0.1

    * Potentially delivered within the next 7-14 days

### Jakarta EE 12

* Project Leyden is coming along. Is there anything we need to think about on the spec level to be able to leverage the faster startup times?
    * Leyden requires modularity?
