                * Use JNoSQL


### Top-of-mind from Ed and Arjan

* Things for project leads to consider
    * Remember to apply the ‚Äúgood first issue tag‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt have any existing issues that have this tag, ask yourself, ‚Äúdo I really not have anything that needs to be done that is a beginner task?‚Äù
    * Think about what you want to contribute to the forthcoming EE retrospective.
* Data impl for GlassFish [8.0-JDK17](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tree/8.0-JDK17).
    * Red Hat impl uses source code to source code translation. They rebuild the war file, add their plugin, including the impl of Jakarta Data. This means the repeatable artifact is the WAR, rather than the WildFly impl that takes the WAR as input.
        * Lukas observed that there are annotation processors that are a part of the TCK. Running the TCK based just on the text of the test is almost impossible. This should be taken as feedback to the authors of the Data TCK. 
            * No info about how persistence provider is supposed to be run.
            * No info about having CDI ready.
            * Lukas can reproduce results with Hibernate.
        * Captured as [https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/737](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/737) 
* Ed is taking DTO next week. Arjan to run the meeting.
