### Refactoring Progress Report

* Marlow: [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190) (JPA appclient tests fail) has updated information but still not solved.  
  * Seeking status on [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1624](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1624) CDI-JPA integration test.  
    * ACTION: Scott Stark offered to take a stab at creating a PR, given he creates an issue where Arjan can provide some pointers.  
  * If we don’t have the preceding blockers resolved by 2024-11-06  
    * The ability to hit any goal in the preceding bullet point is jeopardized.  
    * Ed extended this to the end of the week.
