## Agenda and Minutes

### TCK Refactoring Progress Report

* Can we already say where we are and what still needs to be done?
    * Activity on Arquillian
        * Few issues created and have been resolved.
            * Junit5 problems
        * TCK tools
            * Parser for build.xml from the EE 10 TCK
        * Main question
            * Java test CTS code has internal logic that depends on the ts.jts file. 
            * Replace porting package with Arquillian extensions
        * Two weeks still needed to be able to deliver an estimation
    * Tests that need test vehicles need properties to generate the deployment method.
        * [https://gist.github.com/scottmarlow/fc5c8be4fb4b69b50bfb1423218b8c5d](https://gist.github.com/scottmarlow/fc5c8be4fb4b69b50bfb1423218b8c5d) has some of the @blah@ properties that in EE 10 were handled by ant scripts and sometimes led to java sources being recompiled by the TCK user.
    * Application Client Protocol in progress
    * Some progress on Jakarta Messaging (JMS) tests. Moved to a separate folder and runner created, but the vehicle port not done yet.
    * Java template files (*.src) copied to .java files with properties filled in for things like @DataSourceDefinition
    * Once the general usage of the open rewrite scripts and ANT build.xml parser is done, the rest of the tests should convert in a quite mechanical way.
* Number of runners for standalone TCKs updated and cleaned, and tested that they actually run:
    * See [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/tree/tckrefactor/glassfish-runner](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/tree/tckrefactor/glassfish-runner)
    * See [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/11/job/standalone-tck/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/11/job/standalone-tck/)
        * WebSocket
        * REST
        * Concurrency
        * CDI (API)
        * Servlet
        * Pages
        * Authentication
        * Faces
        * Security
        * Authorization
* Pushed a draft example of output from current OpenRewrite TCK refactor recipe to [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1344](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1344)
    * ^ **gives an idea of new EE Persistence tests extending existing tests.**
* Can parse the EE 10 ant descriptors to determine the contents of the test artifacts. We can generate code from these using ST4 templates.
* Mostly understand how the JavaTest to

### EE 11

* M4
    * Released to Maven Central
    * ACTION: Ed to create PR to update specifications page
    * Schemas for EE 11
        * If the spec changed, even if there were no changes to the XSD or DTD, we will increment the version number to match the version number of the spec.
        * If the spec did not change, we need to update the metadata so the XSD or DTD shows up in the list of schemas for EE 11.
        * Update platform, web, core to reference latest schemas
        * ACTION: Ivar to do some pre-work to facilitate this.
        * ACTION: Ed to do these changes in alongside of the above PR.
        * EE 10 platform TCK -> Appendix, pasted into 11
            * Describing what the schema rules are
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/906](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/906) is the EE schema issue
        

* Jakarta Persistence and CDI integration
    * Jakarta Persistence side has been released
    * Platform still needs to do something
    * platform change for Persistence?
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746) is a PR for Persistence CDI integration waiting for evaluation.  Will need TCK tests as well.
        * ACTION: Arjan try to implement in GlassFish
        * ACTION: Scott try to implement in WildFly

### EE 12

* Date for Platform release plan like [https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan)
    * Release managers - selected
        * Candidates?
        * ACTION: write mail to list about release coordinators
* Overall theme?
    * New specs . APIS
        * Config
            * Already in the micro profile 
            * Jakarta Config 100% replacement for MP Config
            * MP config split in two parts
                * Low level - to configure CDI
                * High level - based on CDI
            * MP config depending on Jakarta config
            * Jakarta Config in Jakarta Core Profile
                * Micro Profile would import it automatically
                * Two configs in the Micro Profile
        * NoSQL
        * MVC
    * Coherence of platform (again)?
        * Really introduce CDI at more places
        * Common abstraction for HTTP Request / Response
            * Share between REST and Servlet
            * OR…
                * Remove Servlet from platform and rebase everything on REST? (seems unrealistic, but Markus from REST, Core Profile, Quarkus and Micro Profile move towards this)
                * See [https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/pull/1066#issuecomment-1236998345](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/pull/1066#issuecomment-1236998345)
* SE 25 is targeted for September 2025. 
* EE 12 targeted for 1H 2026.
* Component specs can get started on their EE 12 work now.
* We can use the release plan from EE 11 as the starting point for EE 12 but just, “add two years”.
    * May need to refactor which specs go into which waves.
    * We will likely need four milestones to get it all done.
* See [2024-05-21](#bookmark=id.y33tqz7p6nza) for some other details on this.

EE 10

* [https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/jakartaee-tck/jakartaee10/staged/eftl//jakarta-jakartaeetck-10.0.5.zip](https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/jakartaee-tck/jakartaee10/staged/eftl//jakarta-jakartaeetck-10.0.5.zip) is staged and being tested now.
    * Includes Java 21 updates and updates from (optional) legacy schemas to Jakarta EE schemas.
* Concurrency TCK needs to be promoted.
    * Signature testing tooling was updated to jakarta ee tools
        * Just needs to be promoted
* Security TCK service release needs to be released.
    * Signature test needs to be updated
