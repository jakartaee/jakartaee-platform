### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* **Next call: January 7, 2025**  
* Modify CI jobs for all EE 11 to comply with Spec Committee’s process for TCK jars pushed to Maven Central.   
  * Do this before releasing the Core Profile jars to maven central.  
  * See official [document from spec committe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1muzaV5D2p_vP6C-Lu8KFNJ64wA2qNXtaw-SJ1sFgt9I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.c8t4z8ryjz7y).  
    * ACTION: Ed to take this action: push the executables to Maven Central  
      * Currently, the zip file has these jar(s) embedded within the published ZIP. Instead, the above process requires these jar(s) to be explicitly published **along side** the zip.  
      * This request originated from Roberto Cortez from MicroProfile: [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-tck-dev/msg02076.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-tck-dev/msg02076.html)   
      * This enables the:  
        * The SHAS to stay the same  
        * Preserves the license files   
  * Also need to do this for EE 10 (need to understand how we can do such a thing retroactively).  
* Example of the type of failures that we keep running into with the TCK refactoring:  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1699](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1699)  
  * Totally unique problem (we haven’t encountered this specific one before after \~6 months)  
  * The point of bringing this up:  
    * Only related to the tests itself  
    * Completely unrelated to GlassFish or any other server being tested  
    * Illustrate the continued existence of the emergence of unknown unknowns. Each such emergence can introduce a very wide range of delay.  
* Guru suggested an idea for satisfying the Persistence test requirement:  
  * We have the component spec TCK for persistence 3.2 that has been running and passing for six months.  
    * Could we combine this with the existing, passing, platform persistence tests, and call that good enough?  
  * Ed asked for discussion from the spec committee members who are also in the Platform project call if this idea would still pass the ballot process for the specification committee.  
    * Emily asked, but what about the use of Eclipselink, instead of GlassFish? I think you need to run in the container, not standalone.  
    * The discussion proceeded to the topic of what is the current state of affairs for the TCK tests “in container” or “Java SE” mode.  
  * Tom elicited that this proposal includes the assumption that if you run the tests outside the container, they will also run inside the container which is not a valid assumption.  
* Platform TCK did agree to focus on Web Profile TCK  
  * Continue to work on persistence, EJB lite, assembly, signaturetest  
  * Separating out the persistence tests that are only in the Platform.  
    * This is implemented using JUnit tags.  
  * Guru asked for us to define a plan of record for the case when challenges are raised to tests that are both in the Web Profile and Platform.  
    * Consider this scenario:  
      * Complete the Web Profile  
      * During the Platform process, one of these common tests is challenged.  
      * What happens to the instance of this test in the Web Profile? This may happen in connection with a technology that is only present in the Platform profile?  
    * Proposals  
      * make a copy of the test in question  
      * Complete the Web Profile TCK first, but do not go to ballot with the Web Profile.   
* TCK refactoring project understaffed.  
  * Currently  
    * Oracle: 2 staff members full time  
      * Red Hat: 1 staff member full time, often 2  
      * IBM: 1 staff member part-time  
      * Microsoft: 1 staff member part-time (coordinating)  
      * OmniFish: 1 staff member part-time  
      * Payara: 0  
      * Tomitribe: 0  
      * Fujitsu: 0  
  * Do any of the members not contributing yet have engineering resources to donate to the effort?  
* Source of truth of what tests are actually running and passing

### Jakarta EE 11

* Authentication 3.1.1 TCK update  
  * 3.1.1 is staged and is set to be promoted with [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/790](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/790).  
      
* Servlet 6.1.1 TCK update  
  * [Latest staged version](https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/servlet/jakartaee11/staged/eftl/) is from Oct 31  
  * What is the status of getting a newer staged version with the revert done?  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/pull/680](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/pull/680) was merged in and was bad  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/pull/757](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/pull/757) reverted the change and disabled the test  
    * No new staged TCK created since the revert happened


* Validation 3.1 API  
  * Validation implementation cannot go final until some files are added / updated in the API jar.    
  * When will we get a new 3.1.1 release of the API?  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/pull/221](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation/pull/221) appears to be the PR that is needed for a 3.1.1 updated API artifact
