            * Arjan brings a bit of retrospective comment about how we have arrived at a situation where REST, which is a core and very important spec, has very little user-level features to talk about for EE 11. Capture this for EE.next. 
                * Its governance structure is different from other projects. This may be a factor.
                * Some of these are being addressed. [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/rest-dev/msg00254.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/rest-dev/msg00254.html)

### Other business

* Jakarta Data developments
    * [JEA-328](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/328)
* Individual specification TCK requirements for specs getting major/minor updates in EE 11
    * As of Emily’s [email on 2024-02-21](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04415.html), it looks like this issue is resolved. Does anything else remain to be done on this one?
        * Scott Marlow asked a [followup question last night](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04416.html):
            * `Is the described behavior of the "Type 3" meant to say that all EE features are portable to (non-EE) Java SE implementations?  I don't believe so but I am trying to understand if type 3 is specifically talking about the subset of TCK tests that have no EE dependencies?`
            * ~~DONE: Ed to reply and state that we discussed this in the platform call, but we believe the TCK process document needs more clarity.~~
        * [Brian] My final question on my email is still open: "7) Are the spec groups producing major/minor releases aware of these requirements? Where do things stand?"
            * [JEA-337](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/337): Ed to ensure spec project leads for Waves 5 - 8 are aware.
* Platform integration related issues
    * When one migrates code from another Jakarta repository to the platform repo and it contains history, and authors, these are flagged as violating the contributor agreement because they are not platform committers, or historic project committers before Jakarta. The ECA is a global thing is it not?
    * The ‘@’author tagging capability does not work across repositories. If I try to tag a CDI contributor when creating/discussing a cdi-ee-tck label, their github id does not popup as it would in a CDI repo. All Jakarta contributors should be known to the platform repos in some form.
