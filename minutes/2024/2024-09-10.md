    * Including demo of EE 11 Liberty beta on Azure Kubernetes Service.

### Refactoring Progress Report

* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1)
    * JPA [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1371](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1371)
* Total tests numbers have been updated to be more accurate, but reflect EE 10 numbers. It is expected that for EE 11 some of them will have smaller numbers.
* Official statement of the two values: done date , confidence level. 
    * As of 2024-09-04 these were 2024-11-27, 50%
    * We have resolved to optimistically go with Plan A: “get it all done”
        * but keep Plan B: “10/11 hybrid” ready. For details see [Platform TCK call from 2024-09-04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V1dDLJkd14EDRMPeuI0VzPtU4Lbli8FFBd1pLDLlOrY/edit).
* Scott Marlow asked Arjan for the set of numbers with GlassFish 8.0-JDK17 branch. 
    * Arjan looked at this pom file for e.g. the EJB 3.0 tests
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/blob/main/ejb30/pom.xml](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/blob/main/ejb30/pom.xml)
        * [https://github.com/jakartaredhat/wildfly-ee11-tck-runner](https://github.com/jakartaredhat/wildfly-ee11-tck-runner)
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1434](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1434)
    * ACTION: Ed: Manage risk for  “Switching horses in midstream” for TCK runner
        * The WildFly runner for EE 11 is being used to facilitate the refactoring work. But we won’t be able to use this for ratifying compatible implementation certification because, of course, it’s bound to WildFly.
        * We need to get [tck-1434-glassfish-runner](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1434) in shape as soon as possible so it can be used for ratifying compatible implementation certification.
        * **The “switching horses in midstream” part comes from the need to switch over to the [tck-1434-glassfish-runner](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1434) instead of the [wildfly-tck-runner](https://github.com/jakartaredhat/wildfly-ee11-tck-runner).**
    * ACTION: Ed sync with Arjan offline to see about Ed taking over the PR task for Authentication TCK mentioned above.

### Jakarta EE 11

* ACTION: Ed: Milestone 5 release of spec including: get that out by mid-October.
    * [JEA-441](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/441): Ed Spec updates for CDI and Persistence changes.
    * [JEA-248](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/248): Ed Changes in EE 11 section
    * Try to follow the recommendations Ed Bratt gave to Ed Burns over Slack.

### Jakarta EE 12

* Set a target date for having a first milestone plan draft of the EE 12 release plan?
    * Proposal after absorbing last week’s notes:
        * Start iterating on milestone plan draft by end of CY2024.
        * Have announceable draft by end of 2025-02.
        * Have platform plan review by end of 2025-03.
    * Emily
        * Focus in 2025-02 - 2025-03 work with component specs.
        * Wait a minute: we need to think about the component spec plan reviews.
        * We want to announce the swag EE 12 release date on the platform dev and all component specs. From last week: \
 \
“**This is H1CY26.  This means most of the work needs to be completed in CY2025**”
        * Tell component specs: If you want to be on the train you need to have your component plan review by the end of 2025-02.
    * Jan observed some specs will need to do a release, even if they don’t plan to do any feature work, just to accommodate the TCK refactoring changes.
    * Jared observed the top down/bottom up approach impacts our approach here.
        * Two things: 
            * Schedule: timing
                * Milestone schedule
            * Plan: content
    * ACTION: refine this at pre-call Monday 2024-09-16.
* [JEA-414](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/414): Application client deprecation
