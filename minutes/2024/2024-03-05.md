    * 2024-02-29 and M2 actions
        * Ed, Ivar, Arjan
            * Outstanding spec text changes
                * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/807](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/807) 
                * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/855](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/855) 
                * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/854](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/854) 
            * Arjan: 
                * Interceptor’s spec should not be in the platform spec, but should be moved into the CDI spec.  Functionally, it is CDI-like.
                    * Ed, this is a bigger deal. Probably not for 11.
                * Injection of the **Principal** should be part of the security spec, instead of its current location, the CDI spec. Now moved to the platform spec in PR 855.
                    * Jared observed the Servlet aspect, and also points out that the Security spec TCK must test this assertion.
                    * https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/841#issuecomment-1962435660
            * Incorporation actions for updated XML Schemas
            * M2 release
                * Keep iterating 11.0.0-SNAPSHOT as artifacts come in after completing their release review then release 11.0.0-M2 from that.
* Update to EE 11 XML Schemas
    * All component spec projects will see their schemas updated to have the version number they are including in EE 11, even if there are no normative changes.
        * Jared observed that we have not consistently done this in the past, for 10, for example. It seems to have been left up to the specs.
        * [JEA-341](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/341): We the platform project should issue a ruling on this. When the version of the spec is updated, the version of the schemas need to be updated also, to match. Ed to mail to spec-project-leads and platform-dev (and individual emails to spec project leads as well).
            * Scott Marlow did point out that there is a possible time constraint aspect on this. This will take time and people might need to do it for more than one spec.
    * [JEA-201](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/201)
* Wave 5  release review initiated by 2024-03-29

            * Arjan
            * Emily sought a status.
            * Arjan stated the most important part was done a while ago. TCK is part of the platform. RISK FACTOR. Arjan has a plan to mitigate this risk. 
                * “Two tck” solution.
                * Policy class removal
                * [JEA-345](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/345): Ed to capture this into the AzDO for resolution.
            * Emily: will you plan to stage another milestone?
            * Arjan: yes, targeting EE 11 M2 Authorization and Security. 
        * Jakarta Persistence*
            * Lukas
            * Riva asked for the status for M2.  [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/703](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/703)  was filed and review was requested.
            * M2 API in staging since Feb 29

### Other business

* Jakarta Data developments
    * [JEA-336](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/336)
    * [JEA-340](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/340). Ed to update release plan. Change “Wave 6, 7 specs release review initiated by 2024-04-27” to “Wave 6, 7 specs release review initiated by 2024-04-27. Exception for Data. Data will initiate release review by 2024-05-31.”
* Individual specification TCK requirements for specs getting major/minor updates in EE 11
    * [JEA-338](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/338)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/issues/1868](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/issues/1868) 
* EJBHome issue, raised by Jared Anderson. Platform TCK has to cover the platform requirements, and no more. For the EE 11 release, EJB will still be included. EJB includes 2.x interfaces. All optional components will be removed unless they are specifically included by the platform. Will the EE 11 platform include the requirement for EJB 2.1 to be implemented or not.
    * If it is not, should we produce an EJB jar that does include them? An optional jar?
    * There’s the TCK side
    * There’s the platform side.
