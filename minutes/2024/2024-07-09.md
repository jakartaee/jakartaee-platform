* Jakarta Persistence and CDI integration
    * Jakarta Persistence side has been released
    * Platform still needs to do something
    * platform change for Persistence?
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746) is a PR for Persistence CDI integration waiting for evaluation.  Will need TCK tests as well.
            * Discussed this with a view toward eliciting what aspects are controversial, if any.

        * ACTION: Arjan try to implement in GlassFish
        * ACTION: Scott try to implement in WildFly \

    * What to do with these (are they among the removed optional ones?):
        * Jakartaee_web_services_metadata_handler_3_0.xsd
            * Defined by JAX-WS.

        * jakartaee_11.xsd
        * application_11.xsd

### Jakarta EE 12

* Jakarta Config for EE 12
    * Jan talked to MicroProfile about this last week. These discussions were motivated by some MP telemetry changes that might need it.
        * Emily suggested we defer discussion until MicroProfile 7 has been released.
            * Jan suggested we get all the stakeholders in: Dmitry, Roberto Cortez, Emily especially.
    * One idea mooted is to put Jakarta Config in Jakarta EE Core
        * Maybe split up functionality. One part to Jakarta. Other part, based on that, but remaining in MicroProfile.
            * Arjan: what motivates this?
            * Jan: Avoiding circular dependency to allow CDI to use it, but not introduce dependency on CDI in MicroProfile.
    * These ideas are still under discussion under the Jakarta Config group.
* Extract “converter concept” from the specs that have it.

### OCX

* “Meet the experts” session. Help people get hands on and resolve issue. Somewhat “hackathon” style.
* Repeat the call for putting the “good-first-issue” tag on issues.
