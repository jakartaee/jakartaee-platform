## Agenda and Minutes

### [JEA-276-mitigate-gh-platform-820](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/276)
* [JEA-289-request-progress-review-ballott](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/289)
    * See [d537ee](https://github.com/azure-javaee/specifications/commit/d5357ee8b4345eec8edf5fcab7d8ed993cd6a4c9).
    * Jan Westerkamp
        * From an implementation perspective, we need to verify that 21 is also tested.
        * There is a risk that component specs, because they have a choice to do 17 **or** 21**, instead of 17 and 21**, may have late-discovered problem when we do the platform testing toward the end of the release cycle.
    * Ed proposed this remedy
        * Stay on top of them to see if they can do the 17 and 21 testing.
        * If a component spec is not able to do the non-mandatory **17 and 21** testing, offer help to do this testing.
    * Emily yes, this is documented and agreed already.
    * Tom Watson
        * Again, this is identical to the 11/17 for EE 10 (now 17/21 for EE 11)
    * Emily mentioned one possible interpretation of ​​[https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/?version=1.3](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/?version=1.3) compels us to produce a new milestone release.
        * Ed observes that the process experts, Paul and Wayne, did not mention this. Therefore, Ed will proceed to comply with the existing request as shown in JEA-289 and cross this bring if we come to it.
        * Brian Stansberry had a different reading about us being compelled.
            * [Brian] This came from the more 'flexible' language in https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/guide/#progress
                * That language references the efsp language Emily linked, but otoh somewhat contradicts it (e.g. the projects "are not ready for a release yet"). Although 'milestone build' and 'release' are different terms, so I think Emily's interpretation is the better one.
* [JEA-279-GlassFish](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/279)-as-ratifying-compatible-implementation Jakarta Data help
    * Confirm that Data can be reasonably implemented entirely based on existing primitives from Persistence and/or JDBC.
    * See [discussion comment in the issue](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/279#4254914). Most important point: the need to get a “project” started to host collaboration for a Data impl that GlassFish can use. This is where the “chip in” work happens.

### [JEA-275-EE11-M02](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/275)
* Date review
    * [Jakarta EE 11 Release Plan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan)
* Risk factors
    * REST 3.2
        * Progress being made is towards 3.2 that deprecates @Context injection, however Dmitry passed along a comment from Jan Supol that Jersey may not be able to find a clear way forward to allow Jersey to be a 3.2 impl. The stakeholders are engaged.
    * Concurrency
        * Issue open in the spec to change the API to
            * Remove javadoc references, hard coding instead
            * Some of that is held up about what is the 17 behavior when the user says virtual: true.
            * ~~ACTION: Nathan, put a link to this issue.  \
Here is the issue where we could use more feedback in deciding the Java 17 behavior: \
[https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/415](https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/pull/415)~~
    * CDI
        * Action to comply with the formerly known as CDI EE idea will also be taken in time for the 2024-02-29 release review. 
    * Jakarta Validation and Records status
        * The M2 release is ready that has some aspects of this. The “new of a record” thing is obviously not possible to perform validation.
        * They have what they plan to do for EE. For the most part, “records just work”.
    * Jakarta Concurrency and Virtual Threads
        * Overview of change to strategy vis a vis Java 17
    * Arjan: GlassFish will be doing a multi-release JAR to make this happen. Unclear how this will work in the server, it compiles, it runs the test, have not yet integrated in the server. 

### Beyond Jakarta EE 11 (if time allows)
* [Jakarta EE Working Group Brainstorm Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tVaCmbXdAS_Ddn7LMPDelpOfAyozChXL/edit)
