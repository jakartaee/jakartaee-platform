## Agenda and Minutes

### Top-of-mind from Ed and Arjan

* Service release:
    * **Expression Language 6.0.1**
        * Fixes NPE within the API. Very questionably how any implementation could have passed this, unless they used a different API artifact from the official released one (which we allow)
        * OR… expression language is a pure client side test, and it always picks the expression language AP jarI that you want it to test LAST(!).
            * There’s 1 API jar coming in as a dependency from the TCK itself (!), which is used for the tests before the one you want to be tested
            * If your runner uses a parent pom, possibly multiple jars will be on the classpath
        * Arjan has staged this service release and is seeking feedback. ACTION: If no feedback, Arjan will release it. See [JEA-407](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/407).
        * ACTION: Update dependency version in jakartaee api project.
            * [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/pull/167](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-api/pull/167) 
            * See [JEA-411](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/411).
* House cleaning of projects [JEA-326](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/326).
    * Many projects have long lists of committers that have never been active or haven’t been active since many years
    * Good idea to start some cleaning?
    * Example;

### TCK Refactoring Progress Report

* [Status Board](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/2)
    * Do all items on the board have to be done in order to ship EE 11?
    * Can some of the items be skipped, or partially done? Shipped incrementally?
    * Can some of the items be deferred to EE 12?
    * What is good enough to get EE 11 out the door?
    * Marlow: [will look at integrating new ant parsing approach with an OpenRewrite recipe](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck-tools/issues/44)** \

### Jakarta EE 11

* XML Schemas
    * Schemas proposed complete. 
    * Thanks to everyone that contributed on the email [thread](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04488.html)! 
    * ACTION: Please check [https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/#11](https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/#11) if there are any updates needed.
* API artifacts
    * A couple of service releases added
    * QUESTION: When do we cut a RC1 release?
        * Service releases
            * Tags [JEA-242](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/242)
            * Connectors [JEA-417](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/417) ACTION: Ed needs to understand the impact of this on EE 11.
            * EL
        * ANSWER: Yes, let’s cut an RC1 when these are in.
* Milestone release process
    * Ed Bratt wrote: “Are you using the Github Release / Tags feature when you make Platform releases? If not, I wonder if we might want to consider that?”
        * No, but we should have been doing that. I have filed [JEA-408](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/408).
* Conversation on [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746) seems to be going well, not sure if there are any more questions pending regarding `A prototype of adding persistence requirements for CDI in EE environments`
    * We need implementations to try it still.
    * We also need a list of what will not work with Persistence CDI in EE.

         \


### Jakarta EE 10

* [https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1935](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1935) TCK challenge proposal to accept the Faces challenge for running on Java 21.
    * I think we are waiting on Faces team to agree that a user workaround is approved of ignoring the test failure on Java 21.
    * The Faces 4.0.x branch needs someone to fix a build failure, not sure when that might happen.  Otherwise, we would try to fix the failing test.
    * Any concerns?

### Jakarta EE 12

* Some discussion about removal of Application Client in EE 12. See [JEA-414](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/414).
* ACTION: Nathan raised a good question about dependencies and javadoc.
    * What is the guidance for spec JavaDoc that wants to link to a different spec JavaDoc that wouldn't otherwise be a dependency? For example, if JavaDoc includes {@link Resource}, this adds value to the user who can follow the link, but it comes at the cost of the spec declaring a dependency on Jakarta Annotations. If the JavaDoc instead refers to it as {@code jakarta.annotation.Resource} then there is no dependency, but there user isn't able to follow a link to the JavaDoc for Resource. This scenario comes up often enough. Is there any recommendation or requirement on which direction we should be taking?
    * Lukas Jungmann had some other observations about this. If the spec makes a behavioral dependency on another spec, should this be encoded in the POM?
