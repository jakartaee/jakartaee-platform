### [Jakarta EE 11 Release Plan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan)

### Top-of-mind from Ed and Arjan

* Jakarta Data ratifying compatible implementation
    * Replied to Gavin King: [https://twitter.com/edburns/status/1774810065561911428](https://twitter.com/edburns/status/1774810065561911428) 
        * This is still tied to Hibernate
        * Arjan reiterates the request to move the code out to a separate project, a hacking project.
            * This could be done with a throwaway SPI.
        * Scott Marlow does observe that the **StatelessEntityManager**, while essential for Persistence.next itself, is not on the critical path for EE 11.
            * Scott also observed this is not the appropriate forum.
    * How is Liberty solving this problem? They use the **EntityManager** (stateful) as if it were stateless. Yes, it does pass the TCK.
    * Dmitry did ask about the feasibility of IBM to make it possible for the Liberty data impl to serve as an extraction for the “hacking project”?
        * Answers
            * It is very deeply integrated into the rest of Liberty.
            * It is not realistic from a human resource perspective.
            * The impl itself is not in a state where it’s realistic to pull it out.
            * While the impl is indeed open source, the impl is not in a good position to serve as an extraction for the “hacking project”.
    * Emily did state that Liberty **will be the impl for passing the Data component spec **TCK but **IBM cannot commit to Liberty being the ratifying compatible implementation of the platform specification**.


### First waves

* Wave 1 - 4 release review initiated by 2024-02-29 (leap day) and M2 \

    * Looks like Interceptors is having some trouble.

    * EL: Ivar changed it to **DONE**.
    * Milestone release status
        * Ed/Arjan need to ensure the milestone release job is in good shape: gpg key expired, needed to be updated. Currently.
        * ACTION: Arjan to send an email to spec-project-leads reminding the responsible parties of the need to validate their gpg keys
            * Subject: REMINDER: make sure your gpg keys for producing API artifacts from CI/CD jobs are refreshed.
        * Spec edit status: ready for M2 spec release
        * ACTION: Ed to make PR to update the page
            * Make sure it clearly states **DRAFT** status and states **11.0.0-M2** as the version.

### Next waves

* Marlow: Can we have milestone releases for EE 11 Platform TCK artifacts?
    * Any issue with milestone TCK releases using EFTL license?
        * Yes, there is an issue. Milestone releases must not have the EFTL license.
    * Can we release TCK Artifacts directly to a public Maven Repository?
        * Yes.
    * Can we push milestone releases of TCK Artifacts directly to a public Maven Repository?

* Concurrency

    * This is what they intend to use for the 2024-04-26.
    * Regarding the meaning of “virtual = true”? On 17: it is “ignore”
* Data
    * Status update from Nathan
    * Request for meeting between Ed and Nathan to be briefed on what is the absolute latest news on Data that you want to present during Ed and Ivar’s talks at JavaLand and DevNexus.


### Other business

* Marlow: Not really a platform concern but still mentioning for sharing knowledge [https://github.com/jakartaee/specification-tools/blob/master/promotion/promote-release.sh](https://github.com/jakartaee/specification-tools/blob/master/promotion/promote-release.sh) doesn’t seem to add the EFTL license to TCK archives.
    * Should it?
    * No, because the promote script can not automatically add the EFTL license to the zip.
        * Ed Bratt states this is because doing so would modify the SHA sum. Furthermore, if the contents of the zip file is changed, it would invalidate the CCRs based on proposed-final TCKs.
* Batch
    * Question about spec update? in response to EE 10 TCK challenge [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakarta.ee-spec/msg03260.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakarta.ee-spec/msg03260.html)  (which we’re waiting to resolve to release the TCK update supporting Java 21 for EE 11)
