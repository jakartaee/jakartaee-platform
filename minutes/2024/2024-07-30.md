## Agenda and Minutes

### Refactoring Progress Report

* Removing tests for optional, and therefore removed, specifications.
    * We will prune additional tests as we encounter them.
    * This will make it faster to iterate on the remainder of the work, because it will decrease the overall time it takes to run the complete TCK.
* [Status Board](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/2)
* Please consider attending the Platform TCK call: 11 am EDT Wednesday 2024-07-31.

                * EL
    * ANSWER: Yes, let’s cut an RC1 when these are in.
* @Resource and CDI/JPA integration
    * [Look to deprecate JNDI, @Resource, @Resources in favor of Config](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/355)
        * Even though this references Config, I believe we should deprecate JNDI, @Resource and @Resources to allow for removal in EE12 or later.
        * Table discussion of [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/355](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/355) until + are on the call.
    * [CDI/JPA Integration](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746)
        * This is ready to merge. Further updates should be made as the TCK tests are written to address outstanding questions on the PR.
    * Scott Marlow voiced concern that the persistence stakeholders may not be paying attention to the platform mailing list, so the issue may not have adequate representation.

### Jakarta EE 12

* Application client removal
    * ACTION: [JEA-415](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/415) Ed polls vendors.
