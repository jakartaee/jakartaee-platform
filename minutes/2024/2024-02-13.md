### [JEA-275-EE11-M02](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/275) Date review
* [Jakarta EE 11 Release Plan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan)
    * For release review, you need a TCK and a compatible implementation.
    * Specs are welcome to go earlier than these dates, if desired.
    * Wave 1, 2, 3, 4 specs release review initiated by 2024-02-29 (leap day)
        * Jakarta Annotations*
            * Common annotations TCK staged! Thanks!
                * [https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/tckprocess/](https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/tckprocess/) needs an update still to allow Java SE TCKs to be used for Spec Ballot review.
            * Is there a staged release of the Annotations 3.0 as well?
                * Milestone 1 API has been released.
                * CDI needs a final staging.
                * Lukas just came back from vacation this week.
        * Jakarta Expression Language*
            * M2 API published in maven
            * Alwin staged Standalone TCK at [https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/jakartaee-tck/jakartaee11/staged](https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/jakartaee-tck/jakartaee11/staged) (Tested with Glassfish8-M1, Tomcat - by spec team member).
            * Also needs a TCK Process doc change to meet this date with a Java SE style TCK.
        * Jakarta Interceptors*
            * Scott will do a final release for interceptors.
        * Jakarta Lang Model*
        * Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection*
        * Service releases
            * Arjan: across-the-board dependency updates for service releases.
                * Ed, Arjan, Ivar start making PRs to resolve these things now.
            * Jakarta JSON Processing*
            * Jakarta Activation*
            * Jakarta Mail*
            * Ed clarifies that these things must happen for M2. The M2 is scheduled to happen as soon as possible after the 2024-02-29 service releases. So, this work can happen after the 29th, but really should be as soon as possible.
        * Discussion notes
            * Will the EE 10 TCKs for the service releases be refactored TCKs?
                * ~~ACTION: Ed to respond to thread and share opinion that for component specs that only do a service release, we should not be using the refactored TCKs. Just stick with the same, non-refactored, ones for EE10.~~ [JEA-313](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/313)
    * After this, we will have M2.  Other specs are encouraged to do a refresh of what they did for M1, with any updates.
        * Concurrency
        * Security
        * REST will not be releasing an artifact for M2. 
            * Emily observes this indicates risk for having an update to REST for EE 11.
    * Wave 5 specs release review initiated by 2024-03-29
        * Jakarta RESTful Web Services*
            * REST 3.2?
                * ~~ACTION: Ed to request Santiago to join these platform calls.~~ Sent email.
                * Group has still not decided to pursue this 2024-03-29.
                * Need to decide if we can use RestEasy instead of Jersey as the compatible implementation.
                * Jan Supol is not sure if the proposals in 3.2 are implementable. Some of the matters are impl details. 
        * There are some outstanding questions, Dmitry requested other REST team members to follow up on Jan Supol’s questions.
        * Jakarta Authorization*
            * Has made significant progress, API is in good shape.
            * TCK needs to be updated
                * New tests within progress
                * Existing tests within platform TCK
        * Jakarta Persistence*
            * EclipseLink status? Dmitry indicates it’s in good shape.
            * Need to have a release for M2.
            * Dmitry will pass to Lukas to get a release both for GlassFish and for EE11 M2.
        * Jakarta Server Pages*
        * Jakarta Servlet*
            * Outstanding issues, but very likely not going to be addressed in EE 11
                * ServletContainerInitializer ordering.
        * Jakarta Validation*
            * Same as last week.
        * Jakarta WebSocket*
    * After this, we will have M3.  Other specs are encouraged to do a refresh of what they did for M2, with any updates.
    * Wave 6, 7 specs release review initiated by 2024-04-27
        * Jakarta Data*
        * Jakarta Concurrency*
            * Concurrency spec is now blocked on adding support for Java SE 17 because some participants are maintaining that the decision has not yet been made by the Platform to require support of Java SE 17.
            * Nathan: some issues for 17
                * Waiting for the ballot to close.
                * Participants are challenging the need to support it.
                * ~~ACTION: put out an official statement on the support for 17~~. See [email](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cu-dev/msg00497.html).
                * Three options currently on the table:
                    1. Virtual: true is simply treated as false if you are on 17.
                    2. Virtual: true request will fail if running on 17.
                    3. Behavior is left vendor specific.
        * Jakarta Faces*
            * Downgraded to 4.1, not a major release. Work done last December. Still need to pass the TCK.
        * Jakarta Security*
            * Builds on authorization, add the CDI native version of that work. Permission store concept.
            * Emily observes the spec prose has not been updated.
            * Arjan responds: the API and Javadoc is where the bulk of the normative assertions are made.
            * Adam Yoho: No update on JWT in Security. It’s in the bridge spec.
        * Jakarta Authentication*
    * After this, we will have M4.  Other specs are encouraged to do a refresh of what they did for M3, with any updates.
* Arjan: Multi-release JAR. Seeking reference to commit
