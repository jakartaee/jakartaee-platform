Agenda and Minutes

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* TCK, of course  
  * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190)   
    * David took urgent action at personal inconvenience. Thanks for that. Can we meet that action with yet more urgency?  
      * Scott Stark said, “We can certainly use this as a workaround for now.” So, what’s the status of this?  
      * Marlow: With the lookup-name test hack, seeing some local success of appmanagedNoTx testing  
        * Tests also use ejb-link which is interesting that adding \`lookup-name\` helps.  
        * appmanagedNoTx \- Container-managed stateful session bean using \`@PersistenceUnit\` annotation to inject an \`EntityManagerFactory\`; the \`EntityManagerFactory\` API is used to create an Application-ManagedResource Local \`EntityManager\`, and uses the \`EntityTransaction\` APIs to control transactions  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1624](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1624)   
    * Scott Stark opened this PR to GlassFish to implement the required specification text: [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/pull/25209](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/pull/25209)   
      * Need reviewers. Ed is not qualified.  
* EE 11   
  * Web and Platform   
    * Spec edits from Jared: [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/983](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/983)   
      * Thank you Jared  
  * Core Profile release  
    * Scott Stark has some follow up actions to take after review from Emily  
      * ACTION: Ed Burns to ensure Scott Stark is aware of the need to take action.  
    * Approve certification requests  
      * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/978](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/978)  
      * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/975](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/975) 

### Refactoring Progress Report

* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1)  
* We didn’t meet the deadline of completing the EE 11 Platform TCK by Nov 8, 2024  
  * **What is the new EE 11 schedule for Web/Platform specifications?**  
    * Complete the EE 11 TCK refactoring.  
    * Can we still deliver in CY2024?

### Jakarta EE 11

* Faces updates  
  * 4.1.1 TCK is staged [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/faces/jakartaee11/staged/eftl/jakarta-faces-tck-4.1.1.zip)  
    * [JEA-473](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/473) Ed will create a PR to [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) with updated link to promoted TCK ( and request spec committee to promote)   
    * Due to API change, need to possibly update the signature test for the Faces TCK.  Need to run TCK against Mojarra 4.1.2.  
      * Not sure how – no obvious tasks found here: [https://ci.eclipse.org/faces/view/Release/](https://ci.eclipse.org/faces/view/Release/)   
      * [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-11/job/11/job/standalone-tck/job/jakarta-faces-tck-glassfish-mojarra412/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-11/job/11/job/standalone-tck/job/jakarta-faces-tck-glassfish-mojarra412/)   
  * 4.1.2 API   
    * Update complete and promoted  
    * Jakarta EE API updated to pull in the 4.1.2 API as well

* Authentication 3.1.1 TCK update  
  * Staged version has been created and validated that it resolves the problems.  
  * Still needs to be promoted to be publicly available.  
  * ACTION: Ed to follow the same process as above for the Faces 4.1.1 activity.

* Servlet 6.1.1 TCK update  
  * Ran into some issues with the service release and had to revert a PR due to adding new tests to the TCK

* REST SPEC API \+ What about [https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1262](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/issues/1262) \+ Java Security Manager?  
  * Do we need a service release or minor or major release from REST to remove the Security Manager from the REST SPEC API?  
    * Thinking no.  This work could be done as part of Jakarta EE 12 along with other specification APIs that need updates..  
    * Should we update [https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/11/](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/11/) to remove \`Remove all use of SecurityManager\`.  
      * [https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/11/jakarta-platform-spec-11.0-m4\#jakarta-ee-security-manager-related-requirements](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/11/jakarta-platform-spec-11.0-m4#jakarta-ee-security-manager-related-requirements)  
        * \`The Jakarta EE 11 release removes the requirement to use a Java security manager.\`  
        * ACTION: Ed to update the release plan to state the same text as in the spec.  
        * This will be the sum total of action taken on this matter for EE 11, at this very late stage in the release. We will clean up the remaining references completely in EE 12\.
