## Agenda and Minutes

### Top-of-mind from Ed, Arjan and Jared

* 6 weeks remain until we need to start ballots.  
* Seeking review for [PR 962](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/962), follow up to PR 746\.  
* Migration of Jakarta EE TCK to new backend storage device:  
  * [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/5070\#note\_2831922](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/5070#note_2831922)   
    * As per [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/5070\#note\_2831922](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/5070#note_2831922) the current plan is to copy the [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/) Jenkins disk to a new disk tonight.  During this call, if anyone prefers to wait until next year or some time later this year to bring our TCK Jenkins environment down for migrating to a new disk system, please speak up.

### Refactoring Progress Report

* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1)   
* Scenarios  
  * What if we wanted to pull the plug and just finish today?  
    * Will EE 11 have the same level of testing as 10?  
      * Let’s say we’re at 50%. Is that enough?  
    * Plan of record  
      * Get CI recovered after [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/5070\#note\_2831922](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/5070#note_2831922) is resolved.  
      * In parallel, get a baseline from vendors for EE 10  
      * ACTION: Get CI set up to give us that number for EE 11  
* Can we release the Core Profile ahead of the rest of it, with Liberty as the ratifying compatible implementation?  
  * **UPDATE**: Liberty team ran with the Core Profile 11 component spec TCKs and the CoreProfile 10 TCK with Java 17 and things look good.  Still need the CoreProfile 11 TCK to exist with any updates needed for EE 11\.  
* Ed to ask Will Lyons to attend TCK call tomorrow.  
* TCK results wiki pages  
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-results-for-Glassfish](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/wiki/Jakarta-EE-10.0-TCK-results-for-Glassfish)

  * Ivar can send mail to project leads pointing to [https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee12/JakartaEE12ReleasePlan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee12/JakartaEE12ReleasePlan)   
  * Brian to ask James to send a mail to REST.  
  * Brian can send a mail to CDI.  
  * Nathan can ask Data.  
* Should we ask the Spec Committee to ask for progress reviews from “quiet specs”, e.g.   
  * Config  
  * NoSQL  
  * RPC  
* Jan laid out a possible roadmap for getting Config unblocked  
  * Find a technical solution  
    * Do the work in MP config  
      * Separate out the CDI-dependent vs non CDI dependent parts  
      * The non-CDI dependent part could be put into Jakarta Core Profile  
    * Avoid discussing organizational aspects.
