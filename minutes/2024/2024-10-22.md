### Refactoring Progress Report

* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1)  
* Scott Marlow gave status on the issue currently blocking him from progress on JPA refactoring. Still fully blocked. See [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1371](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1371)   
  * Scott Marlow will file an issue on the GlassFish side or go to the mailing list.  
  * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190) has the \`No object bound for java:comp/env/ejb/Stateless3VehicleBean STATUS:Failed.Test run in stateless3 vehicle failed.\` but not the cause unless I missed it.  
* Scott Stark is working on the CDI EE TCK. This will be the largest bucket of net-new Platform TCK tests for EE 11\.  
  * ACTION: create row in project board for this work. This is follow up work to [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1484](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1484) Scott Stack expects to have a value for **GF Passing**.   
  * ACTION: compute new status update table after the CDI+EE number in preceding item.
