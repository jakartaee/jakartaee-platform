### Other business

* Jakarta Data
    * Things did settle down, but people have been opening issues.
    * Work is going on in the query language.
    * [JEA-358](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/358): Ed to send mail to data-dev
        * We discussed this in the platform project
        * I understand there have been some changes committed that are not related directly to the JPQL subset. This is not what we agreed. Please cut it out. This slows down progress and jeopardizes the EE 11.
* Jakarta Transactions
    * Module-info. Make the CDI dependency in the module-info static. If this is all that is done, it can be called a service release.
    * If there are bigger changes, it will need to be a minor release.
    * This is related to CDI.
    * ACTION: Ed to ask Scott Stark to what extent this must be addressed for EE 11.
