    * Before the ballot starts, you can make the necessary changes freely. Once a ballot starts, the code is frozen. If a change is needed, a ballot must be withdrawn. Once the change is done, a new ballot must be started with a new mentor review.  If a SPEC API/TCK artifact has been released, any further changes will incur a release (see more [info](https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/tckprocess/) here).
    * When doing the platform TCK release, some TCK updates might happen on some component spec TCK outside platform TCK, which might require a new ballot.
    * Scott: Messaging, JSON-B, JSON-P (maybe more) TCKs are using EJB 2.x and they need to be updated. 
    * Post EE 11
