## Agenda and Minutes

### Top-of-mind from Ed and Arjan
* What to report to steering committee
    * M3 is staged
        * Platform state 
        * Blockers
            * Ballots for
                * Persistence - ballot ongoing
                * Pages
                * WebSocket
                * Servlet
        * Report to steering committee: M3: all artifacts pushed to maven central and specs published no more than 5 days after the last of the ballots close.
            * Arjan risk level
                * GlassFish hasn’t got
                    * Data
                        * Hibernate based Data impl
                        * Need something that runs in GlassFish
                            * NoSQL
                    * Concurrency
                        * TCK requirement JNDI scans, annotation vs. CDI scans
                        * Asynchronous scheduling annotation implementation.
                * There is a separate branch ([8.0-JDK17](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tree/8.0-JDK17)) for JDK 17. This is the one for the ratifying compatible implementation..
                    * The process is time intensive to run the TCK on 17 and 21.
* EJB in EE 12
    * Arjan: EJB in EE has no future. CDI centrality. Reza’s ambassadors effort.
    * Werner: could become optional at some point. Or maybe only make it optional in the Web profile. EJB-lite does still exist in the Web profile.
        * There was an idea to do “EJB ultralite”, which is most of EJB, but implemented on top of CDI. The goal is not full compatibility, but good enough compatibility.
    * Emily: functionality comparison was done. We need to refresh this. We need the contribution of the CDI and Concurrency communities. 
    * John C:  if we plan on breaking backward compatibility, we need close consultation from our customers.  Announce in EE 12, and actually do something in EE 13.
    * Werner K: In maven, the latest version, 4.0, has 10k downloads.
    * Bottom line: The most we will do for 12 is say something like, “we’re continuing to think about it, but it’s certainly not going to be a drastic removal”.
