    * [JEA-248](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/248): Ed Changes in EE 11 section
    * Try to follow the recommendations Ed Bratt gave to Ed Burns over Slack.
* Brian Decker agreed to have a PR out by the end of this week that will enable a service release of the Authentication TCK as requested by Jared Anderson.
    * Possibility of the need to do a service release of the WebSocket TCK. He would also look into that.
* Jared, can you make the Specification Committee meeting tomorrow, 2024-09-18?

### Refactoring Progress Report

* **We have 9 weeks including this one.**
* [https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1)
* Refactoring progress report
    * 2024-11-27 at 50%. Any update from Scott Stark or Scott Marlow?
        * Ed will ask again at the TCK meeting tomorrow to move this in to 2024-11-18
    * Jakarta Persistence tests
        * The biggest group of tests in the platform TCK
        * Scott Marlow is working on having these running against WildFly
        * Need to have these running against GlassFish 8.0-JDK17 also.
        * Test configuration combinations are posing challenges, that Scott Marlow is working
* Manage risk for  “Switching horses in midstream” for TCK runner
    * [tck-1434-glassfish-runner](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1434) Arjan progress report:
        * WildFly runner repo: [https://github.com/jakartaredhat/wildfly-ee11-tck-runner](https://github.com/jakartaredhat/wildfly-ee11-tck-runner) 
        * Quite early
            * Blockers encountered by Arjan right now:
                * Problematic install script that aborts with:
                    * “JBoss CTS scripts repository, needs VPN access to download in order to setup the TCK environment”
                        * Scott Marlow added that because WildFly hasn’t open sourced its TCK porting kit.
                * Script clones/installs
                    * jakartaee/platform-tck
                    * eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck-tools
                    * —> Publish milestones to not have such moving target???
        * Core Profile TCK
            * ACTION: Ed to ask about this tomorrow at TCK call.
            * How did we release EE 10 without GlassFish passing the core profile TCK?
                * WildFly and Liberty passed the core profile tck.
                * So we “spread the ‘passing’ around among different implementations”.
                * This is still a valid compliance strategy for EE 11.
                    * Jared Anderson believes if the core profile TCK did exist, the next Liberty beta would pass it.
            * [https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/certification/10/](https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/certification/10/) lists others that have passed with EE 10.
            * Jan brought up the question of other implementations passing the Core Profile TCK
                * Quarkus
                    * John Clingan to check with his SME, Roberto.
                * Helidon
