## Agenda and Minutes

### Top-of-mind from Ed and Arjan

* Logistics item
    * Ed cannot attend the Steering Committee call today. Can anyone here represent the Platform Project at that call? It starts 30 minutes after this call completes.
    * Arjan agreed to cover for Ed.
* Risk management
    * Data impl for GlassFish [8.0-JDK17](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tree/8.0-JDK17).
        * [https://github.com/jakartaredhat/hibernate-data-tck-gf/issues/1](https://github.com/jakartaredhat/hibernate-data-tck-gf/issues/1)
            * Resolved
            * Runner passes all Jakarta Data TCK tests
            * [https://github.com/jakartaredhat/hibernate-data-tck-gf/wiki/JD_100_TCK_Results](https://github.com/jakartaredhat/hibernate-data-tck-gf/wiki/JD_100_TCK_Results)
            * [hibernate-data-tck-2](https://github.com/jakartaredhat/hibernate-data-tck-gf/issues/2)
        * Approach used by Hibernate Data Repositories 6.6.0.Alpha1:
            * Use static metamodel generator hibernate-jpamodelgen to generate the code.
            * Bundle the generated code into the war.
            * Use the WAR to pass the platform TCK
            * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tags](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tags)
        * Plan of record for GlassFish 8.0-jdk17 is to use the work that Scott Stark has done in order to pass the platform TCK as the Ratifying Compatible Implementation.
            * Other compatible implementations can use different approaches.
            * Ed and Arjan extend a big thanks to Red Hat for this.
    * Finish the platform / profile TCKs
        * Go to a weekly cadence on the platform TCK meetings from now until we are done.
        * Ed will commit to attending from now until we are done.
        * Need to decide
            * Ask for more time to get the refactoring complete for EE 11.
                * “Not an option to stall the refactoring mid-way”
            * Go back to the JavaTest way, again, for EE 10.
                * Ed and Jan agree this would be a very bad outcome, because this would be the second major release where we did this.
        * When can we ask for a date? Or a date for a date?
        * [Open ReWrite recipes to refactor ](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/wiki/OpenRewrite)(wiki)
            * Alternative (web) solution [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1319](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1319) (Standalone Persistence TCK runner inside Glassfish).
        * Platform TCK call **last** week: update?
    * Update of spec text in platform 
        * Spec integration text added to the platform / profile specs?
        * May be platform / profile specific tests needed to be added 
        * Action: Now that the components are done, it is time to focus on the Platform and profile spec updates and tests.
        * Action for all: Read through the changes made since EE 10
            * E.g. 
                * Component specs listed are EE 10 versions still
                * platform change for Persistence?
                    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746) is a PR for Persistence CDI integration waiting for evaluation.  Will need TCK tests as well.
                * CDI Integration changes from CDI spec moved over to the platform / profile specs?
                * ACTION: Ed to review this PR in concert with Lukas Jungman
* [Emily] Jakarta Validation TCK needs to do a service release to pick up the following 2 PRs
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/validation-tck/pull/198](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation-tck/pull/198)
    * ACTION: Scott will need do the service release. 
    * ACTION: Jared to raise challenge on [validation-spec](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation-spec) repo for 198. 
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/validation-spec/issues](https://github.com/jakartaee/validation-spec/issues)
* [Emily] Jakarta Tags needs to do a service release to address
    * ACTION: Paul Nicolucci working on this.
    * Challenge 1:[ https://github.com/jakartaee/tags/issues/256](https://github.com/jakartaee/tags/issues/256)
    * Challenge 2:[ https://github.com/jakartaee/tags/issues/255](https://github.com/jakartaee/tags/issues/255)
        * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">platform-tck PR:[ https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1312](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1312)</span>
    * IMPL/API PR:[ https://github.com/jakartaee/tags/pull/254](https://github.com/jakartaee/tags/pull/254)
* Question for the TCK Project: Have the CDI tests been moved from the CDI TCK to the Platform TCK/Web Profile TCK/Core Profile TCK?
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1220](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/pull/1220) needs to be moved into the refactor branch
    * Verify with Scott Stark if the work is complete
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1315](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1315) is tracking issue for merging master branch Platform tck changes to the tck refactor branch.
* For EE 12 can the mentor review happen during the Milestone or Release Candidate releases instead of during the release review? (Kyle Aure)
    * Jakarta Data and Jakarta Concurrency have suffered many iterations of re-releasing their GA versions
    * The mentor review happened during the release review process where checklists were provided that we had not previously known. (at least I did not because this is my first time)
    * Action: The spec committee should reach out to the spec projects for input to the retrospective, such as provided above.
