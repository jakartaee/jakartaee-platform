Agenda and Minutes

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* Dec 3 is JakartaOne.  We are canceling this meeting next week so people attend JakartaOne.   
* Core profile status.  
  * Emily sent the Core Profile to ballot last week.  
  * Ballot will close December 4 unless all voters complete their vote early  
  * Ed asked, “Does anyone anticipate any controversy?”  
    * Emily did some whipping actions.  
      * Currently have 7 \+1 votes.  
      * Need Oracle, Payara, TomiTribe.  
    * ACTION: Ed or Emily bring it up at the Spec Committee call.  
    * Let’s aim to close it during week 48\.  
* Confirmed sunset of Eclipse Forums (“ Eclipse IT update”) does not impact [mail archives](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04584.html).  
* [JEA-483](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/483): Ballot among Platform Project committers regarding TCK exclusion list.  
* Update from TCK project regarding “adding the @EJB annotation to all vehicles and updating the few application-client.xml descriptors to use the fixed lookup-name. Need to verify this work on glassfish.”  
  * Did this work?  
  * Marlow: Not yet as per comment https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190\#issuecomment-2501255470  
* Arjan’s observation about the state of some non-appclient tests?  
  * “If other non-appclient tests are still failing or haven't even been run yet, we may not be able to start the ballot anyway.”  
* Need to understand a proposal that lets us get the Web Platform out in CY2024, let Platform Platform go to 2025  
  * Jan: move AppClient out of Jakarta EE 11 Web Profile so that Web Profile can be put to ballot  
    * AppClient is NOT part of Web Profile already.  It is only in the platform  
  * Deprecate App Client in Jakarta EE 11  
  * ACTION: Ed to start \[DISCUSS\] thread about this idea. [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04585.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04585.html)   
* ACTION: Ed to start \[DISCUSS\] thread about marking AppClient deprecated in EE 11 [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04586.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04586.html) 

### Refactoring Progress Report

* Can we immediately prioritize the more important non-appclient tests, since we committed to having all of these running by 2024-12-15”  
* Scott clarified that the “appclient” tests in question aren’t actually testing App Client itself, but use app client to call EJBs where (some of) the JPA tests are run.

### Jakarta EE 11

* Authentication 3.1.1 TCK update  
  * Two new challenges opened with proposed PRs attached  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/authentication/issues/227](https://github.com/jakartaee/authentication/issues/227)  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/authentication/issues/228](https://github.com/jakartaee/authentication/issues/228)  
  * 3.1.1 TCK is staged, but not prompted yet.  Would like to get these two challenges in and re-stage 3.1.1 to avoid having to do a 3.1.2 soon after 3.1.1

* Servlet 6.1.1 TCK update  
  * [Latest staged version](https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/servlet/jakartaee11/staged/eftl/) is from Oct 31  
  * What is the status of getting a newer staged version with the revert done?


* Validation 3.1 API  
  * Hearing that the Validation implementation cannot go final until some xml files are updated.  I see in [staging](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/staging/jakarta/validation/jakarta.validation-api/) that the maven-metadata.xml files were updated yesterday for the validation API artifact to be different than what is in [maven](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/jakarta/validation/jakarta.validation-api/)  
  * Maven metadata updates will be moved to maven soon?

### Jakarta EE 12

* Scott (and the TCK team) proposed to decouple “JDK-update” releases from feature releases in two separate release trains  
  * Train 1: Just whatever necessary to pass on JDK x  
  * Train 2: New features  
* Train 1 would be released e.g. 6 months after “an LTS release of Java SE”  
* Train 2 would be released between the train 1 releases, e.g one year after

* Spring 7 planned for November 2025  
  * [https://spring.io/blog/2024/10/01/from-spring-framework-6-2-to-7-0](https://spring.io/blog/2024/10/01/from-spring-framework-6-2-to-7-0)   
  * Is there anything we should pay attention to?  
* What about JSpecify?  
  * [https://jspecify.dev/](https://jspecify.dev/)   
  * Anything we should look at?

Agenda and Minutes

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* TCK  
  * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190)  
    * Have work around that can be used to validate that there are no other issues with the app client tests.  
      * [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-tck-dev/msg02114.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-tck-dev/msg02114.html) has three possible options (1-3) for moving forward  
        * Switch from "ejb-link" to "lookup-name" option 1  
          * Were there any lookup-name tests previously?  Looks like we do have it in EJB tests.  
        * Reconsider how we run the Persistence tests on EE 11 implementations option 2  
          * Would be a large change  
        * Stay on the current path option 3  
      * It will be advantageous for another vendor to try these tests to see if they have the same problem with Wildfly for example  
        * Other vendors may be able to debug easier to determine what is wrong with the tests  
    * Still trying to find a fix though in glassfish it appears?   
  * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1624](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform-tck/issues/1624)   
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/pull/25209](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/pull/25209) has been merged into glassfish  
    * Implementation is working  
    * Test updates are needed  
      * CDI qualifiers may need to be updated in the tests  
  * Tanya asked about status in general for where we are with web profile / platform before end of year completion  
    * TCK work is still happening in earnest  
    * Would like multiple vendors for ratification, but likely not able to be there by end of year  
    * Likely it is going to bleed into 2025, but how far into 2025 is the question  
      * There will be release activities that will be required once we have the TCK complete.  CCR, javadoc, API, etc.  Can do some of those things earlier to avoid the cost at the very end.  
      * Could do a shortcut, but would require a vote possibly by the platform specification committers, i.e. stop at some point and exclude tests that aren’t ready yet

      

* Core Profile release  
  * Scott Stark had some follow up actions to take after review from Emily which required a respin of the TCK  
    * Errant Java 11 reference in the TCK zip still.  Looking to delay updating that into a future version of the TCK (version 12\) and not require a respin  
    * Still waiting on getting an update to link to the implementations and not just the names of the implementations  
      * ACTION:  Ivar and Jared worked with Emily during the call for what the text should look like.  [https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/782/files](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/782/files) has the suggested changes to be applied to the PR.  
      * ACTION:  Follow up with Scott Stark.  Ed sent a text.  Scott Marlow to follow up as well.  
    * With these latest changes, the release review should be able to go to ballot by the end of the week.  
  * Certification requests updated to use the new TCK  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/978](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/978)  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/975](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/975) 

### Refactoring Progress Report

* 

### Jakarta EE 11

* Faces 4.1.1 TCK update  
  * TCK is now published

* Authentication 3.1.1 TCK update  
  * TCK isn’t published yet, but expect a new challenge from IBM this week that could possibly have a fix included into 3.1.1 so don’t need to do a 3.1.2 for the new challenge

* Servlet 6.1.1 TCK update

### Jakarta EE 12

* Security manager removal: we mean it this time.
