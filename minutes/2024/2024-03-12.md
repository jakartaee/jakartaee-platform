                    * Essentially done - due to be merged
                    * ACTION: review by Arjan
            * Arjan: 
                * Interceptor’s spec should not be in the platform spec, but should be moved into the CDI spec.  Functionally, it is CDI-like.
                    * Ed, this is a bigger deal. Probably not for 11.
                * Injection of the **Principal** should be part of the security spec, instead of its current location, the CDI spec. Now moved to the platform spec in PR 855.
                    * Jared observed the Servlet aspect, and also points out that the Security spec TCK must test this assertion.
                    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/841#issuecomment-1962435660](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/841#issuecomment-1962435660)
                    * ACTION: Arjan to copy over Principal concerns to Security spec:

            * M2 release
                * Keep iterating 11.0.0-SNAPSHOT as artifacts come in after completing their release review then release 11.0.0-M2 from that.
                * Policy of always updating, despite any normative changes being there or not

### Other business

* Jakarta Data developments
    * [JEA-336](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/336)
    * [JEA-340](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/340). Ed to update release plan. Change “Wave 6, 7 specs release review initiated by 2024-04-27” to “Wave 6, 7 specs release review initiated by 2024-04-27. Exception for Data. Data will initiate release review by 2024-05-31.”
* Individual specification TCK requirements for specs getting major/minor updates in EE 11
    * [JEA-338](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/338)
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/issues/1868](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/issues/1868) 
* EJBHome issue, raised by Jared Anderson. Platform TCK has to cover the platform requirements, and no more. For the EE 11 release, EJB will still be included. EJB includes 2.x interfaces. All optional components will be removed unless they are specifically included by the platform. Will the EE 11 platform include the requirement for EJB 2.1 to be implemented or not.
    * If it is not, should we produce an EJB jar that does include them? An optional jar?
    * There’s the TCK side
    * There’s the platform side.
* Annotations TCK needed for GlassFish 8.0.0-M3
    * Is that [https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/11/job/standalone-tck/job/eftl-annotations-standalonetck-build/](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/job/11/job/standalone-tck/job/eftl-annotations-standalonetck-build/) (???)
    * Annotations doesn’t really its own TCK normally -> find out the what/how…
* Authorization new TCK has started
    * OLD (Javatest / Ant) based TCK still in platform
    * Move that to an “old but standalone” TCK?
        * Or keep and update within the platform?
* Concurrency
    * @Lock annotation 
    * Still time to add that?
