### Jakarta EE 11

* [JEA-441](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/441): Ed Spec updates for CDI and Persistence changes.
* [JEA-248](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/248): Ed Changes in EE 11 section
* [JEA-439](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/439): Need owner Fix table 2 \

### Jakarta EE 12

* Set a target date for having a first announceable draft of the EE 12 release plan?
    * What have we publicly stated for EE 12?
        * Goal is LTS + 6 months. This is H1CY26. 
            * This means most of the work needs to be completed in CY2025.
            * Wave 1 2026-01
    * Ivar stated it is more useful to have target dates for the component specs.
        * Each of the component specs must produce a platform plan review
        * Take the EE 11 release plan and add N months. Aim to have the milestones overall earlier in the cycle than we did in EE 11.
    * Jared observed the top down/bottom up approach impacts our approach here.
        * Two things: 
            * Schedule: timing
                * Milestone schedule
            * Plan: content
    * Jan observed that the wave ordering will need to be refreshed based on the changes we made in EE 11.
* [JEA-414](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/414): Application client deprecation
