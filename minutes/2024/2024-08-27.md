    * [JEA-436](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/436): Prune the **Porting** list to remove all rows pertaining to technologies under discussion for deprecation
        * [Dashboard link](https://github.com/orgs/jakartaee/projects/12/views/1). Show **Porting** section.
    * Prune the Refactoring (was **Porting)** section to remove rows that we can afford to simply not test for compatibility in EE 11, relying on the honor system from vendors?

            * SAAJ #1373
            * Prune jakarta.ejb.EJBHome from TCK tests (impacts around 215 tests)?
