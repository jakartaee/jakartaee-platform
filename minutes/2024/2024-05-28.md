## Agenda and Minutes

### General

* For EE 12 can the mentor review happen during the Milestone or Release Candidate releases instead of during the release review? (Kyle Aure)
    * Jakarta Data and Jakarta Concurrency have suffered many iterations of re-releasing their GA versions
    * The mentor review happened during the release review process where checklists were provided that we had not previously known. (at least I did not because this is my first time)
    * Action: The spec committee should reach out to the spec projects for input to the retrospective, such as provide above.
