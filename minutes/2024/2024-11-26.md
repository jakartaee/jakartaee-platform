Agenda and Minutes

### Top of mind for Ed, Arjan, Jared

* Dec 3 is JakartaOne.  We are canceling this meeting next week so people attend JakartaOne.   
* Core profile status.  
  * Emily sent the Core Profile to ballot last week.  
  * Ballot will close December 4 unless all voters complete their vote early  
  * Ed asked, “Does anyone anticipate any controversy?”  
    * Emily did some whipping actions.  
      * Currently have 7 \+1 votes.  
      * Need Oracle, Payara, TomiTribe.  
    * ACTION: Ed or Emily bring it up at the Spec Committee call.  
    * Let’s aim to close it during week 48\.  
* Confirmed sunset of Eclipse Forums (“ Eclipse IT update”) does not impact [mail archives](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04584.html).  
* [JEA-483](https://dev.azure.com/jakarta-ee-azdo/jakarta-ee-azdo/_workitems/edit/483): Ballot among Platform Project committers regarding TCK exclusion list.  
* Update from TCK project regarding “adding the @EJB annotation to all vehicles and updating the few application-client.xml descriptors to use the fixed lookup-name. Need to verify this work on glassfish.”  
  * Did this work?  
  * Marlow: Not yet as per comment https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/25190\#issuecomment-2501255470  
* Arjan’s observation about the state of some non-appclient tests?  
  * “If other non-appclient tests are still failing or haven't even been run yet, we may not be able to start the ballot anyway.”  
* Need to understand a proposal that lets us get the Web Platform out in CY2024, let Platform Platform go to 2025  
  * Jan: move AppClient out of Jakarta EE 11 Web Profile so that Web Profile can be put to ballot  
    * AppClient is NOT part of Web Profile already.  It is only in the platform  
  * Deprecate App Client in Jakarta EE 11  
  * ACTION: Ed to start \[DISCUSS\] thread about this idea. [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04585.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04585.html)   
* ACTION: Ed to start \[DISCUSS\] thread about marking AppClient deprecated in EE 11 [https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04586.html](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jakartaee-platform-dev/msg04586.html) 

### Refactoring Progress Report

* Can we immediately prioritize the more important non-appclient tests, since we committed to having all of these running by 2024-12-15”  
* Scott clarified that the “appclient” tests in question aren’t actually testing App Client itself, but use app client to call EJBs where (some of) the JPA tests are run.

### Jakarta EE 11

* Authentication 3.1.1 TCK update  
  * Two new challenges opened with proposed PRs attached  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/authentication/issues/227](https://github.com/jakartaee/authentication/issues/227)  
    * [https://github.com/jakartaee/authentication/issues/228](https://github.com/jakartaee/authentication/issues/228)  
  * 3.1.1 TCK is staged, but not prompted yet.  Would like to get these two challenges in and re-stage 3.1.1 to avoid having to do a 3.1.2 soon after 3.1.1

* Servlet 6.1.1 TCK update  
  * [Latest staged version](https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/servlet/jakartaee11/staged/eftl/) is from Oct 31  
  * What is the status of getting a newer staged version with the revert done?


* Validation 3.1 API  
  * Hearing that the Validation implementation cannot go final until some xml files are updated.  I see in [staging](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/staging/jakarta/validation/jakarta.validation-api/) that the maven-metadata.xml files were updated yesterday for the validation API artifact to be different than what is in [maven](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/jakarta/validation/jakarta.validation-api/)  
  * Maven metadata updates will be moved to maven soon?

### Jakarta EE 12

* Scott (and the TCK team) proposed to decouple “JDK-update” releases from feature releases in two separate release trains  
  * Train 1: Just whatever necessary to pass on JDK x  
  * Train 2: New features  
* Train 1 would be released e.g. 6 months after “an LTS release of Java SE”  
* Train 2 would be released between the train 1 releases, e.g one year after

* Spring 7 planned for November 2025  
  * [https://spring.io/blog/2024/10/01/from-spring-framework-6-2-to-7-0](https://spring.io/blog/2024/10/01/from-spring-framework-6-2-to-7-0)   
  * Is there anything we should pay attention to?  
* What about JSpecify?  
  * [https://jspecify.dev/](https://jspecify.dev/)   
  * Anything we should look at?
