## Agenda and Minutes

### Top-of-mind from Ed and Arjan

* Share outcome of steering committee meeting last week.
    * Notified Steering committee of delay due to platform TCK.
    * Did state: one quarter, but hope to bring that in.
    * Ed committed to get fully involved in the Platform TCK effort.

### TCK Refactoring Progress Report

* Scott Marlow on vacation time today.
    * He did note these topics of discussion
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/906](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/906)
            * Schema versions to be included
            * ACTION: Ed to reply with plan of record for schema versions in EE 11.
        * [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/907](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/issues/907)
            * @DataSourceDefinition: should this be validated by the Platform TCK? It seems we don’t know the right place to put this test. The reason is likely due to the implementation of this feature is very much from JDBC, which, of course, is in Java SE.

### EE 11

* All ballots for EE 11 are complete.
* Milestone 3
    * ACTION: Ed to update specifications page to point to M3 artifacts.
    * Otherwise all done with M3.
* Milestone 4
    * In staging
        * [Platform](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/staging/jakarta/platform/jakarta.jakartaee-api/11.0.0-M4/)
        * [Web Profile](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/staging/jakarta/platform/jakarta.jakartaee-web-api/11.0.0-M4/)
        * [Core Profile](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/staging/jakarta/platform/jakarta.jakartaee-core-api/11.0.0-M4/)
    * Will position this as “release candidate”
    * ACTION: Ed to review [https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746](https://github.com/jakartaee/platform/pull/746) needs to be evaluated and applied to the spec and TCK tests added for it.


### EE 12

#### Release coordinator for EE 12

#### Java version (this is the fourth time we have done it this way)

	Doing it this way made it possible for [Spring 6.2 to depend on EE 11 APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUz4LKZx83g&t=523s).

Copied from [EE 11 release plan](https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/jakartaee11/JakartaEE11ReleasePlan), but changed 17/21 to 21/25.

* SE 25 is targeted for September 2025. 
* EE 12 targeted for 1H 2026.
* Component specs can get started on their EE 12 work now.
* We can use the release plan from EE 11 as the starting point for EE 12 but just, “add two years”.
    * May need to refactor which specs go into which waves.
    * We will likely need four milestones to get it all done.
* See [2024-05-21](#bookmark=id.y33tqz7p6nza) for some other details on this.

#### EE 12 Java version

For the Jakarta EE Platform (Platform, Web and Core), the Java compiler `--release` option is 21. For the component specs, the Jakarta EE Platform requires the Java compiler `--release` option is **at most** 21, but component specifications can decide on a lower level.

* Component spec TCKs and platform TCK must compile at Java 21 or less.
* A compatible component impl must pass their component TCK when run under Java 21 or 25.
    * To ratify a component specification, there must exist an implementation that passes on Java 21. There must also exist an implementation that passes on 25.
    * These need not be the same implementation. There can be one implementation that passes on 21 and a different one that passes on 25.
* A compatible platform impl must pass the platform TCK when run under 21 or 25.
    * To ratify a platform specification, there must exist an implementation that passes on 21. There must also exist an implementation that passes on 25.
    * These need not be the same implementation. There can be one implementation that passes on 21 and a different one that passes on 25.
