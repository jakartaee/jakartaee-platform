=== Observer methods in EJB session beans

An observer method may also be a non-abstract method of an EJB session bean class. It must be either a business method of the EJB or a static method of the bean class.

==== Declaring an observer method in an EJB

If a non-static method of a session bean class has a parameter annotated +@Observes+, and the method is not a business method of the EJB, the container automatically detects the problem and treats it as a definition error.

[[observer_method_invocation_context_ee]]

==== Observer method invocation context in Java EE

The transaction and security contexts for a business method of an EJB session bean also depend upon the transaction attribute and +@RunAs+ descriptor, if any.
